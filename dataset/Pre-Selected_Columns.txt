>> MIMIC-III Dataset (26 Tables) ## Documentation can be accessed at: https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/tutorials/intro-to-mimic-iii-bq/

Dataset is arranged according to the following entries:

- Individual Patient is represented with unique ‘Subject_ID’ (Unique Patient)

- Individual Patient is admitted to specific hospital with unique “HADM_ID’
	(single patient can be admitted to one hositpal mutiple times, given unique ID each time >> represents by duplicated ‘Subect_ID’ in one table’)

- Individual Patient was admitted to specific ICU with unique “ICUSTAY_ID”
	(same logic applies here >> admitted to one ICU multiple times, given unique ID each time)

- ITEM_ID >> Specific Test taken in the hospital
	(contains in LABEVENTS, INPUTEVENTS, OUTEVENTS, CHARTEVENTS)



The following are pre-selected columns (as of 06/03/2022):

##### BASIC INFORMATION #####

1. DOB

2. SEX

3. ADMITTIME >> Adunimission Date

4. DISCHTIME >> Discharge Date

5. DEATHTIME >> Date of Death
	DOD_HOSP >> Date of Death in Hospital
	DOD_SSN >> Date of Death in Social Security Database
	## Note: which date of death should be used among above 3?

6. ADMISSION_TYPE >> type of admission

7. EDREGTIME/EDOUTTIME >> Register/Discharge from the emergency department

8. DISCHARGE_LOCATION >> location where the patient was discharged

9. CREATETIME >> the time and date that the cell out was initiated

10. UPDATETIME >> the last time at which the cell out event was updated


##### ICU RELATED INFO #####

11. ICU (TRANSFER & ICUSTAYS Tables): ICU Related information (4 Columns)
	CURR_CAREUNIT >> the last care unit in which the patient was cared for
	INTIME >> Time and data the patient was transformed into the current care unit
	OUTTIME >> the data and time that the patient was transformed out of the current care unit
	LOS >> the Length of Stay for the patient for the given ICU stay, which may include one or more ICU units. The length of stay is measured in fractional days


##### TYPE OF SERVICE #####

12. SERVICES: describes the service that a patient was admitted under (3 Columns)
	PREV_SERVICE >> previous type of service that patient resides under
	CURR_SERVICE >> current type of service that patient resides under
	TRANSFERTIME >> the time at which the patient moved from previous service to current service


##### ENTRENCE LAB TEST #####

13. D_LABITEMS, LABEVENTS Tables: contains information regarding laboratory based measurements (6 Columns)
	ITEMID >> unique id identifying lab measurements
	VALUE, VALUENUM >> VALUE contains the value measured for the concept identified by the ITEMID. If this value is numeric, then VALUENUM contains the same data in a numeric format (different representation of the VALUE)
	FLAG >> indicates whether the laboratory value is considered abnormal or not, using pre-defined thresholds
	FLUID >> substance on which the measurement was made
	CATEGORY >> higher level information as to the type of measurement


##### TYPE OF TREATMENT #####

14. CPT_CD >> contains the original CPT code, which is for billing for procedures

15. CPT_SUFFIX >> contains the text suffix when the CPT_CD contains non-numeric characters

16. ICD9_CODE >> contains the actual code corresponding to the diagnosis assigned to the patient

17. SEQ_NUM >> provides the order in which the ICD diagnoses relate to the patient. ICD diagnoses are ordered by priority - and the order does have an impact on the reimbursement for treatment


##### DRAGS #####

18. DRG_TYPE >> provides the type of DRG code in the entry

19. DRG_CODE >> contains a code which represents the diagnosis billed for by the hospital


#### TESTS UNDER THE STAYS #####

20. CHARTEVENTS: contains all the charted data available for a patient.
	ITEMID >> Identifier for a single measurement type in the database (eg. heart-rate)
	VALUE, VALUENUM >> VALUE contains the value measured for the concept identified by the ITEMID. If this value is numeric, then VALUENUM contains the same data in a numeric format (different representation of the VALUE)
	CATEGORY >> the type of data the ITEMID corresponds to

21. INPUTEVENTS:  Inputs are any fluids which have been administered to the patient
	ITEMID >> Identifier for a single measurement type in the database
	AMOUNT/AMONTUOM >> the amount of drug or substance administered to the patient
	RATE/RATEUOM >> the rate at which the drug or substance was administered to the patient 
	ORDERID >> links multiple items contained in the same solution together

22. OUTPUTEVENTS: outputs are fluids which have either been excreted by the patient or extracted from the patient
	VALUE, VALUENUM >>  the amount of drug or substance excrete from the patient

	## Note: CHARTEVENTS, INPUTEVENTS, and OUTPUTEVENTS may contain duplicated information. Which one to use?
