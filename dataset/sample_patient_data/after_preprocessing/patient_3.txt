Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F with HTN & poorly controlled type I DM, c/b neuropathy,
gastroparesis, nephropathy ?????? CKD, retinopathy presents with DKA
and hypertension SBP to 200s.
.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis: Patient controls diabetes at home with
Humalog SS and long acting Levemir.  Sugars at home recently
have been in 250s. In the ED, glucose was 466. UA was +ve for
ketones ?????? corrected to 200s, but rose again to 300s. She was
treated with an insulin drip which was transitioned to subq when
she tolerated POs. Her electrolytes were repleted and she
received aggressive volume resuscitation. [**Last Name (un) **] saw her and
gave sliding scale recommendations which were implemented. No
source for DKA found, beleived to be [**2-3**] gastroparesis. Nausea
managed with ativan, compazine, and promethazine. She was
discharged on her home Insulin and sliding scale with
instructions to follow-up with [**Last Name (un) **].

# HTN: Hypertensive with SBP in 190s initially, attributed to
DKA, as she has experienced in the past. As she improved her
blood pressures normalized and she was re-started on her home
Lopressor and Midodrine regimen.

# Coffee grounds emesis: Emesis started off as clear, then with
prolonged wretching, she started having coffee-grounds vomiting.
This had also occurred on prior admissions for DKA with
associated vomiting. Her hematocrit remained stable and her
hematemesis self-resolved, and so work-up was deferred to the
outpatient setting.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease, Stage III: Patient's Cr on
admission was 2.7, trending down to 2.1-2.3 following fluids,
consistent with her known CKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Diabetic keotacidosis
Hematemesis (blood in your vomit)
Hypertension
Chronic renal insufficiency

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with DKA, hypertension, and
blood in your vomit. You were initially treated in the ICU with
an insulin drip, and your blood sugars improved. Your blood
pressure medications were adjusted to better control your blood
pressure while you were in DKA, but you were re-started on your
home regimen at discharge. The blood in your vomit was likely
secondary to mechanical trauma from repeated wretching, but you
should follow-up with your primary care doctor to discuss
whether you should undergo further evaluation such as an upper
endoscopy. Given your complaints of chronic cough and heartburn,
you should also discuss beginning a trial of a proton pump
inhibitor such as Nexium or Prilosec to see if this helps your
symptoms.

Your insulin regimen was adjusted by the [**Last Name (un) **] team while you
were here. You should continue to follow-up with them with any
questions or concerns regarding your insulin management.

Followup Instructions:
Please call Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 805**]' office to schedule a follow-up
appointment within 7-10 days of discharge. Her office number is
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 85219**].

You should also continue to follow-up with your [**Last Name (un) **] doctors
as needed.
