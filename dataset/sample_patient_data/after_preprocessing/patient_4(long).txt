PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding from tracheostomy.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from tracheostomy.

PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy and iced normal saline
lavage.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems following tracheostomy
performed on [**2185-11-4**], with new-onset bleeding from
the tracheostomy site.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was in the supine
position with normal oxygen saturation at 35% trache mask.
The patient was sedated with fentanyl and Versed and flexible
bronchoscope was introduced through the tracheostomy site
after a time-out was performed.

We then injected 1% lidocaine through the bronchoscope to
numb the airways and navigated the bronchoscope through the
right main stem carina initially.  There was a large clot
seen at the bronchus intermedius at the opening of the right
lower lobe which we sucked out.  We then saw evidence of
abrasive bleeding from the takeoff of the right lower lobe
which we irrigated multiple times.

Once we navigated the scope through the segments of the right
lung, we then moved our attention to the left lung and found
that that was clear.  We then returned to the area which was
seen to be bleeding at the takeoff of the right lower lobe
and performed iced normal saline lavage.  We monitored this
area for several minutes and found that the bleeding was not
continuous and was stable.

We then pulled the bronchoscope back through the tracheostomy
and pulled the tracheostomy itself back to look at the origin
of the trache and the stoma itself, and there was no evidence
of bleeding at that area and the site looked intact and well-
healed.  We then terminated the bronchoscopy.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and a postoperative
chest x-ray was obtained which showed no change from prior
examination.

We informed the medical team that if the patient continued to
bleed, that interventional pulmonology should be contact[**Name (NI) **]
for possible intraoperative intervention.

SURGEON'S STATEMENT:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present throughout
the entire procedure.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 year old female with a history of HTN, DM,
hyperlipidemia, and OSA who presented to [**Hospital6 **] on
[**2185-10-20**] with 3 days of HA, sorethroat, myalgias, and epigastric
pain with some associated nausea. Upon arrival to the OSH ED,
she had a temp of 101. Per report, initial EKG was
non-diagnostic but CEZ were initially positive with CPK of 574,
MB of 11.5, and TropI of 14.96. She denied chest pain initially
and shortness of breath. She had several ECGs performed there,
which show initial T wave inversions in lateral leads (10AM, no
symptoms), followed by an ECG with inferior ST elevations with
an RCA (III>II) occlusion pattern that apparently occurred with
chest pain. She was started on a nitro drip and Integrillin.
However, it appears that the ST elevations were missed and she
was transferred under the auspices of an "NSTEMI". She had also
developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine rise from 1.2
to 3.1 on [**10-21**].
.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], she was found to be ashen in color, and
hypotensive with blood pressure of 95-105/50s, with sats of
90-93% on 5LNC.  An ECG was performed, which showed the same
inferior STE, and at 2:45PM a code STEMI was called and she was
taken to the cath lab. In the cath lab, she was found to have
diffuse multivessel disease with 70% distal thrombotic left main
lesion, 60% RCA, diffuse disease in the LAD, and 60% RCA. Her
culprit lesion was felt to be the distal LAD lesion. While
preparing for a diagnostic IVUS of the LMCA and prior to LAD
PCI, the patient had an episode of hypotension, bradycardia, and
hypoxia. She was intubated and received atropine, epinephrine,
and emergency pacing with tempory pacer wire placed. Started on
dopamine and levophed. She received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS
in her distal LAD. A right iliac angioplasty was also performed.
 An IABP was placed. The levophed was able to be weened off and
milrinone was started with an increase in CI from 1.5 to 2.1
L/min.
.
Rest of ROS unable to be obtained due to intubation.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this co-dominant system revealed
severe three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a distal 70%
thrombotic
lesion.  The LAD had diffuse disease with a proximal 60%
stenosis and
serial 40-50% stenoses throughout the remainder of the vessel,
which was
approximately 2.25mm in diameter.  The LCX had a 60% stenosis at
the
origin, with diffuse disease in the OM1 and OM2, which were
approximately 2.0mm in diameter.  The RCA had a proximal 60%
stenosis,
with a long 50% stenosis in the mid-vessel, which was 2.5mm in
diameter.
The PDA and PL were diffusely diseased and small.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left- and right-sided
filling
pressures with mean RA pressure of 31 mmHg and mean PCW pressure
of 30
mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary hypertension, with systolic
PA
pressure of 48 mmHg.  The cardiac output was low prior to
intervention
and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump at 2.85 L/min, and
increased
to 3.78 L/min following IABP placement and initiation of
milrinone.
3. Supravalvular aortography revealed no significant aortic
insufficiency, aortic dilation, or aortic dissection.
4. Distal aortography revealed diffuse severe disease with 50%
stenosis
below the renal arteries.  The renal arteries themselves were
single
bilaterally and without significant stenosis.  Difficulty was
encountered during passage of the access wire.  Iliac
angiography
revealed mild disease in the left common iliac artery, with a
patent
internal iliac artery and widely patent common femoral artery.
The right
common iliac artery had an 80% stenosis, and the right internal
iliac
artery was occluded.  The right common femoral artery was widely
patent.
5. Successful PTCA of the right CIA stenosis with a 5.0x20mm
Admiral
balloon.
6. Successful direct stenting of the LMCA with a 2.5x12mm Vision
stent.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow.
7. Successful direct stenting of the proximal and mid LAD with a

2.25x28mm and a 2.25x28mm Vision stents. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
TIMI III
flow.
8. Successful placement of a temporary pacing wire in the RV
with pacing
required to restore heart rate.
9. Successful deployement of 30CC IABP.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output, managed by IABP.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by PTCA of
vessel.
4. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
5. Aortic atherosclerosis with right iliac disease.
6. Successful PTA of the right CIA stenosis.
7. Successful PCI of the LMCA and LAD.
8. Successful deployment of IABP.

[**10-28**] CT A/P
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The lung bases reveal small
bilateral pleural
effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
Atherosclerotic coronary
calcifications are partially imaged. There is no evidence for
pericardial
effusion.

Limited non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen and adrenal
glands is
unremarkable. The pancreas demonstrates fatty atrophy but is
otherwise
unremarkable. Contrast from recent intravenous administration
persists within
the kidneys and renal collecting system, which are enhanced
symmetrically
without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A nasoenteric tube
terminates in the
duodenum. Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of
normal caliber
and there is no pneumoperitoneum. Mild ascites is noted,
predominantly
perihepatically and perisplenically. There are no pathologically
enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Severe
atherosclerotic
calcifications involve a hypoplastic aorta.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon is
unremarkable. The
uterus is unremarkable. The bladder contains a Foley and
non-dependent air. A
small amount of free pelvic fluid is noted.

Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Diffuse
subcutaneous edema is identified.

CT SINUS [**10-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal fluid collection or abscess identified.
2. Anasarca with bilateral small pleural effusions and small
ascites.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus soft tissue changes with
high-density material in
both ethmoid air cells and right frontal sinus, which could be
secondary to
blood. However, this could be due to inspissated secretions.
Presence of
fungal colonization should be excluded by clinical correlation.

Tissue from left leg [**11-21**]
The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,
"[**Known firstname 84627**] [**Known lastname 28942**]", the medical record number and "left calf." It
consists of multiple fragments of  soft tissue and muscle which
measure in aggregate 14 cm x 8 cm x 5 cm.  The skin surface
appears to be [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and grossly necrotic in areas. Serial
sectioning reveals [**Doctor Last Name 352**] necrotic appearing muscle and soft
tissue. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A-C.

   TISSUE (Preliminary):
      [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS, PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.    MODERATE
GROWTH.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.

[**11-21**]
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver is normal in
echogenicity with no
focal masses. Layering sludge is seen within the gallbladder.
There is no
gallbladder wall thickening, distention, or fluid collections.
The common
bile duct measures 5 mm.

IMPRESSION: Gallbladder sludge. No evidence of cholecystitis.

ECHO [**11-12**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded (the
distal LV and apex not well seen). Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Left calf debridement:
Skin with ulceration with underlying muscle and soft tissue with
necrosis, acute and chronic inflammation and yeast and hyphal
forms consistent with [**Female First Name (un) **].

[**2185-11-30**] MRI Spine:
IMPRESSION: Study is somewhat limited by persistent patient
motion artifact, as well as the lack of diffusion-weighted
sequence, with:
1. No finding to specifically suggest anterior spinal cord
infarction.
2. No evidence of acute spinal epidural or subdural hematoma, or
other cord compressive process.
3. Widely capacious spinal canal.
4. Grossly unremarkable appearance to the thoracoabdominal
aorta, with no
focal aneurysmal dilatation or evidence of occlusion or
significant stenosis.

[**2185-12-6**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with distal apical hypokinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Regional dysfunction c/w distal LAD disease.
Impaired left ventricular relaxation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

[**2185-12-6**] EMG:
Clinical Interpretation: Complex abnormal study. There is
electrophysiologic evidence for a severe ongoing neurogenic
process in all 4 extremities. Given the severity of
abnormalities in the lower extremities as compared to the upper,
possibilites include critical illness neuropathy, with a
superimposed acute focal process involving the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
cell innervation to the lower extremities, as in an acute
myelopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year old female with HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia who
presents with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
.
# s/p ST elevation MI: admitted [**10-21**] with chest pain, went to
cath lab, where cath revealed 70% RCA proximal lesion with good
flow and diffuse LMCA and prox LAD stenoses. She received 1 BMS
to her LMCA and 2 BMS in her distal LAD. A right iliac
angioplasty was also performed.  During procedure, pt became
bradycardic and nearly coded, requiring atropine and a temporary
wire (dc'd on [**10-23**]). She was urgently intubated, and
dopamine/milrinone was started. She was continued on ASA,
plavix, integrellin and statin however BB was held given
hemodynamic instability.  Balloon pump dc'd on [**10-23**] when pt was
discovered to have LLE compartment syndrome.  She was on and off
of her BB with pressors.  Eventually she required Amiodarone for
aflutter correction and this along with metoprolol both rate and
rhythm controlled her.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Pt was in cardiogenic
shock with poor cardiac output, requiring pressors/inotropes and
balloon pump, and became volume overloaded. Balloon pump had to
be d/c'd in the setting of LLE compartment syndrome.  She was
eventually diuresed aggressively with CVVH, and was then felt to
be volume depleted.  She was eventually weaned off of pressors,
her EF was largely preserved at 50%.  She intermittently became
hypotensive with acute blood loss s/p multiple LLE debridment.
She was intermittently requiring pressors and CVVH in this
setting.  She was eventually started on milrinone on HD days,
and metoprolol was held to allow for large volume shifts
associated with HD.

#Arrythmias: In NSR in the unit but had an episode of sinus
arrest in cath lab. Temp pacer in but now mostly native
complexes, pacer removed [**10-23**].  Her heart rate ranged from
tachycardic to normal sinus.  She was observed to be at various
times in Atrial tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation, atrial flutter, the atrial tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation, and atrial flutter eventually resolved with
amiodarone on board.  She remained in NSR for the remainder of
her hospitalization.

# Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure
and probably exacerbated by 320 ccs of contrast recieved in cath
lab.  She developed muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Due to
hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria immediately post cath, she was
treated with CVVHD for volume overload and hyperkalemia.  She
failed repeated trials off of CRRT.  Eventually it was felt that
she no longer required volume removal and she tolerated
intermittent HD without pressors.  Likely now dialysis-dependent
with oliguria, however renal consultants believe that urine
output should be followed closely as she continues to have
potential to regain renal function.

# LLE compartment syndrome: treated with removal of balloon pump
and fasciotomy on [**10-23**].  In this setting she developed
rhabdomyolysis with a peak CK of >100,000.  This eventually
trended down to normal ranges with CVVH and fasciotomy.  Wound
Vac was placed by vascular surgery who observed her on a daily
basis.  She was debrided on [**11-21**] and planned for closure
however the wound was felt to be too big and not appropriate for
grafting.  At that time deep tissue cultures grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
albicans.  Vascular and plastics colaboratively decided to allow
for healing by secondary intention (vs. graft placement).  She
was started on fluconazole, with duration of treatment for
osteomyelitis given proximity of this deep tissue infection to
bone.  She received multple further debridments in the OR and at
the bedside.  Wound vac was in place on both leg wounds.  She
has follow up with vascular surgery and plastic surgery as
outpt.

# Respiratory Failure: Likely due to acute pulmonary edema in
the setting of cardiogenic failure. She required vent support
and was given lasix and ultimately CVVHD for volume overload.
After volume overload was corrected she eventually required less
and less respiratory support, however as she was intubated for
greater than 2 weeks, she was trach'd in the OR.  She eventually
tolerated CPAP, and trach mask.  Passy-Muir trials were
successful on [**11-23**].

# Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated at admission. Likely shock
liver combined with rhabdo.  Statin was temporarily held.  Liver
function tests eventually trended down on there own.  They again
started to trend upwards on fluconazole.  However, she was also
on amiodarone and high dose statin at that time.  LFTs should be
followed as outpt and medications should be adjusted if LFTs
continue to trend upwards.

# Anemia: S/p 27 units pRBC, 2 units FFT, 2 units platelets, 2
units cryo. Ms. [**Known lastname 28942**] had persistent anemia throughout her stay
which required greater than many units of of PRBC. DIC,
hemolysis, and anemia of chronic disease, were all worked up and
considered as causes, and eventually hepatic dysfunction was
settled on as the cause, given concomitant coagulopathy.  As she
stabilized from a hepatic perspective, she continued to have
chronic anemia from renal disease, worsened by acute blood loss
anemia due to leg debridment. Currently receiving EPO with HD.
HCT has been stable for several days.

# GI bleed: on [**11-4**] she was noted to have frankly melanotic
stool.  GI was called who felt she was oozing secondary to
hepatic dysfunction.  The melena resolved with IV protonix for
72 hours, and then [**Hospital1 **].  GI bleed self resolved.

# ID: In the setting of intermittent fevers and WBC elevations
to the 30's she was empirically started on vanc and cefepime to
cover skin flora infecting her leg.  She was ruled out for
C.Diff several times and cultures never revealed a source aside
from klebsiella in her sputum, and coag negative staph in her
A-line (thought to be contaminant).  Her deep tissue cultures
revealed [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  ID followed her  and she was
discharged only on at least a 30 day course of fluconazole, with
instructions to follow up with ID in 3 weeks to determine if abx
regimen at that point is sufficient.  Monitoring of liver
function, CBC, and markers of inflamation should be followed at
rehab and faxed to the ID doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7443**].

# IDDM: Initially high BS on admission.  She was initially
treated with insulin gtt and then transitioned to long acting
with ISS. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recomended ISS given her
highly variable insulin clearance given her volatile renal
function.  Once a regular HD schedule is begun, it is expected
that her insulin requirements will stabilize.  Discharged on 12u
lantus qAM + humalog SSI.  Insulin sliding scale may be titrated
as outpt to achieve glucose of 150-250.

#Lower extremity plegia - Pt was in state of reduced mental
status during the critical portion of her hospital course.  When
she aroused sufficiently to be able to participate in
questioning and physical exam maneuvers it was discovered that
she was unable to move either of her lower extremities and had
minimal to no sensation in both.  Neurology was consulted.
Spinal MRI showed no sign of anterior spinal infarct given h/o
hypotension in setting of baloon pump.  However, EMG showed
evidence of critical illness neuropathy with sign of anterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] involvement.  Pt should be followed up with Neurology as
outpt in one month for reassesment of diagnosis and prognosis of
lower extremity function.

# FEN: Ms [**Known lastname 28942**] was fed through tube feeds.  Multiple feeding
options were used throughout hospitalization, including OG/NGT,
Dobhoff, and attempted PEG placement which failed [**1-31**] body
habitus.  Thoracic surgery felt that laparoscopic G-tube
placement was an option but that her medical issues should be
optimized further before surgery, as they felt that this was
somewhat risky.  Goal is to maintain an albumin of > 2.5 to be
an operative candidate for PEG placement.  She was discharged
with ability to take thin liquids and pureed foods.  She also
had a dobhoff tube placed in the stomach for additional tube
feeds.  Oral intake should be encouraged. Medications should not
be administered through NGT, as it tends to clog. Please
administer medications crushed in puree orally.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Medical Center - [**Hospital1 3597**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses
STEMI
cardiogenic/distributive shock
Left Lower Extremity Compartment Syndrome


Discharge Condition:
The patient is hemodynamically stable without any pressor
requirement.  She tolerates her tracheotomy well and
successfully passed a Passy-Muir placement trial.  Her
neurologic status is difficult to determine; the patient
generally responds to simple commands but is intermittently
either uncooperative or otherwise nonresponsive to questioning.
She moves both upper extremities and her head spontaneously but
has not been noted to have spontaneous movement of either lower
extremity during this hospitalization.


Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28942**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for ST-elevation myocardial
infarction complicated by shock.  She spent an extended period
of time in the hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of
shock.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was initially placed to aid
heart flow but this led to a complication of left lower
extremity compartment syndrome, which necessitated surgery on
the left leg.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 28942**] required mechanical ventilation for respiratory
failure.  Because she was intubated for a prolonged time, a
tracheostomy was placed with a special valve so she could talk
through her tracheostomy hole.

Additionally, her hospital course was complicated by acute renal
failure.  She required regular dialysis during her
hospitalization and it is felt that she will be dependent on
dialysis from this point.

She will need continued wound care for the left leg, and is
followed by vascular and plastic surgery.  An ultimate plan has
not been decided as to how her wound will be closed at this
time; she will need to follow up with these services as an
outpatient.

During her hospital course, Mrs. [**Known lastname 28942**] was found to have severe
lower extremity weakness.  She was seen by the neurologists who
believe that her weakness is due from her prolonged critical
illness.  However, during her heart attack she may have suffered
from a stroke in the spinal cord.  She will need to be followed
by neurology as an outpatient.

During surgical debridement, her deep tissue culture was found
to grow out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans, sensitivities pending.  Per the
recommendations of our infectious disease specialists, she was
placed on fluconazole, with instructions to continue for at
least 3 weeks through her next outpatient appointment, at which
time further recommendations will be made regarding duration of
treatment.  While on the fluconazole, she will need to have
weekly monitored blood work with CBC with differential and LFTs.


She will need continued dialysis, most likely three times a
week.

Many changes were made to Mrs. [**Known lastname 28942**] medication regimen.  PLease
see attached sheet for medication administration.

Please return to the emergency room or call Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 84629**]
physician if she develops increased lower extremity pain or
discharge, fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other
concerning symptom.

  <text-sep> <HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG> <ECG> <NTE> Sinus tachycardia.  Poor R wave progression.  Non-specific diffuse T wave
flattening.  Low QRS voltage diffusely.  Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2185-11-7**] ventricular rate is slower.

 <NTE> Regular narrow complex tachycardia is probably atrial flutter.  Generalized
low voltage is non-specific.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Since the
previous tracing of [**2185-11-6**] ventricular response is now regular and it appears
that atrial flutter has replaced atrial fibrillation.

 <NTE> Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a late transition
that is probably normal. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low voltage in the
limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing the rate is slower.

 <NTE> Atrial fibrillation, rate 157.  Very low voltage throughout the tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2185-11-3**], except for a change from
sinus tachycardia at 114 to atrial fibrillation at a rate of 157, no diagnostic
interval change.  There is poor R wave progression in leads V1-V4.  Consider
anterior wall myocardial infarction of undetermined age.

 <NTE> Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse low voltage diminished. As compared with prior
tracing of [**2185-10-25**] the P-R segment depression is less apparent. These findings
raise further concern regarding pericardial process. Followup and clinical
correlation are suggested.

 <NTE> Sinus rhythm and baseline artifact. There is PR segment depression and
ST segment elevation consistent with pericardial process as recorded on
the tracing of[**2185-10-22**] without diagnostic interim change. The rate has
increased.

 <NTE> Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is short without evidence of pre-excitation.
Minimal ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with prominent
P-R segment depression consistent with possible pericardial disease, although
acute myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. Compared
to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
TRACING #4

 <NTE> Artifact is present.  Sinus rhythm.  There is a late transition which is
probably normal.  Non-specific ST-T wave changes.  Low voltage.  Compared to
the previous tracing there is no significant change.

 <NTE> Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. There is a late transition
that is probably normal. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low voltage in the
limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.

 <NTE> Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is short without evidence of pre-excitation.
There is late transition that is probably normal. There is minimal inferior
ST segment elevation with prominent P-R segment depression consistent with
possible pericardial disease, although acute myocardial ischemia or myocardial
infarction cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to
the previous tracing ventricular pacing is no longer present.
TRACING #3

 <NTE> Initially there is sinus rhythm and then a paced rhythm at a slightly faster
rate. Compared to the previous tracing ventricular pacing is new.
TRACING #2

 <NTE> Sinus rhythm. There is a late transition that is probably normal. There is
ST segment elevation in the inferior leads with reciprocal ST-T wave changes in
the lateral and anterior leads consistent with acute or evolving myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.

 preceding similar study dated [**2185-10-31**].  The patient remains
 intubated, the ETT in unchanged position.  Right-sided internal jugular
 approach sheath remains, left-sided subclavian approach Swan-Ganz catheter
 terminating in central portion of PA.  An NG tube is seen to reach far below
 the diaphragm and this includes the side port.  No pneumothorax has developed.
 Previously described right-sided basal haze has increased and most likely
 represents some pleural effusion layering posteriorly and the patient in
 nearly recumbent supine position.  No new pulmonary infiltrates are identified
 and the pulmonary vasculature does not show a congestive pattern.

 IMPRESSION:  No interval change in instrument positions, no pneumothorax.
 Right-sided basal density most likely representing pleural effusion, appears
 to have increased since yesterday.

 FINDINGS:

 Supine, portable radiograph of the chest is reviewed without previous studies
 for comparison.

 Right internal jugular central venous catheter in satisfactory position with
 the tip in the central superior vena cava.  The endotracheal tube tip is 2.9
 cm above the carina.  There has been placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter via the
 right femoral approach with the tip in the right main pulmonary artery.  An
 intra-aortic balloon pump is in place with the tip in the appropriate position
 inferior to the aortic arch.  There is an additional line adjacent to the
 Swan-Ganz catheter which proceeds into the right atrium and right ventricle
 which likely represents a transvenous pacer via the femoral vein.

 There is mild pulmonary edema with right upper lobe opacity which may
 represent asymmetric edema, or possibly infection.  There is mild
 cardiomegaly.

 IMPRESSION:

 Tubes and lines as described.

 Mild pulmonary edema and opacity in the right upper lobe which may be due to
 asymmetric pulmonary edema or possibly infection.

 EXAM:  CT of the sinuses.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with stroke and increasing white blood count
 and sinus drainage.  Evaluate for infection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the sinuses were obtained with coronal reformats.

 FINDINGS:  There is complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with
 partial opacification of left maxillary sinus with fluid level.  In addition,
 fluid is visualized in both ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses with high-density
 material visualized in both ethmoid sinuses which could be secondary to blood
 products but clinical correlation is recommended to exclude fungal infection.
 Similarly right frontal sinus demonstrates high-density soft tissue material
 with fluid level in the left frontal sinus.  Soft tissue changes are seen in
 the nasopharynx, possibly related to the intubation.  There is no evidence of
 periorbital soft tissue swelling.  No evidence of facial soft tissue swelling
 or fluid collection identified.  Partially visualized intracranial compartment
 demonstrates vascular calcifications.  No other abnormalities are seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Extensive sinus soft tissue changes with high-density material in
 both ethmoid air cells and right frontal sinus, which could be secondary to
 blood.  However, this could be due to inspissated secretions.  Presence of
 fungal colonization should be excluded by clinical correlation.

 HISTORY:  57-year-old woman with eight-point hematocrit drop in the setting of
 coagulopathy.  Evaluate for retroperitoneal bleed.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2185-10-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis without administration of oral or IV contrast.  Multiplanar
 reformatted images were generated.

 NON-CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN:  Small layering bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left, have increased slightly in comparison to [**2185-10-28**],
 with underlying atelectasis.  There is no pericardial effusion.

 The lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of abdominal viscera for focal
 lesions.  Within this limitation, the liver is unremarkable.  Small focus of
 high- density in the dependent portion of the gallbladder may reflect small
 stones. The spleen is normal in size.  There is nonspecific perinephric
 stranding, left greater than right.  The adrenals are unremarkable.  The
 pancreas is atrophic.

 There is a small amount of oral contrast layering in the dependent portion of
 the stomach.  The enteric tube has been retracted and terminates in the
 proximal duodenum.  Loops of small bowel in the abdomen are mildly dilated at
 3.5 cm.  The distal small bowel is decompressed, proximal small bowel loops
 are of normal caliper and a proximal transition point is seen in the right
 lower quadrant [**Female First Name (un) 257**] 60. There is mesenteric fluid in relation to these
 small bowel loops. There is fluid in the right lower that is confined around
 small bowel loops, this can be either due to adhesions or an internal hernia.
 There is oral contrast throughout the colon from the cecum froma prior CT
 examination. There is a small amount of free fluid within the abdomen and
 pelvis. The colon is normal in caliber throughout its course. The abdominal
 aorta is non- aneurysmal in caliber, with dense calcifications extending into
 the iliac arteries.

 NON-CONTRAST CT PELVIS:  There is no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  The
 urinary bladder is decompressed with the Foley catheter in place.  There are
                                                             (Over)

 INDICATION:  PICC placement requested for vascular access and IV antibiotics.
 Patient with STEMI, LLE compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy, fungal infection.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 52**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 53**], and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 731**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63**], the attending
 radiologist who supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  The procedure was explained to the patient.  A pre-procedural
 timeout was performed, confirming the patient's identity using 3 patient
 identifiers, as well as the procedure to be performed.

 Using sterile technique and 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, the right
 basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
 micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and
 after establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed
 over a guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 37 cm in
 length was then placed through the peel-away sheath under fluoroscopic
 guidance, with its tip positioned in the low SVC.  Position of the catheter
 was confirmed by a final fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.  The peel-away
 sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin
 using a StatLock, both lumens aspirated, flushed and capped, and a sterile
 dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well, without immediate complication.

 IMPRESSIONS:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided placement
 of 5-French double-lumen PICC via the right basilic venous approach.  Final
 internal length is 37 cm, with the tip positioned in low SVC.  The line is
 ready for use.

  Study is somewhat limited by persistent patient motion artifact, as well as
  the lack of diffusion-weighted sequence, with:
  1.  No finding to specifically suggest anterior spinal cord infarction.
  2.  No evidence of acute spinal epidural or subdural hematoma or other
  compressive process.
  3.  Widely capacious spinal canal.
  4.  Grossly unremarkable appearance to the thoracoabdominal aorta, with no

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MRI OF THE COMPLETE SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2185-11-30**].

 HISTORY:  57 year-old woman, status post STEMI/cardiogenic shock, now with
 prolonged hospital course with bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of
 sensation; rule out anterior spinal infarct.

 TECHNIQUE:  Routine [**Hospital1 184**] non-enhanced MR examination of the complete spine,
 including large field-of-view sagittal T1-weighted SE, T2-weighted and STIR
 FSE, and axial T2-weighted GRE sequences through the cervical spine and FSE
 sequences through the thoracolumbar spine, were obtained. As the patient is in
 acute renal failure, on hemodialysis (and given the indication for the study),
 IV gadolinium was not given.

 Despite my specific recommendation that the study be performed on the Siemens
 "[**Last Name (un) 62421**]" magnet for dedicated diffusion-weighted sequences, apparently, this
 instrument was not available at the time of imaging.  Note that despite
 repeated medication of the patient during scanning, many of the images,
 particularly the sagittal STIR sequences, are motion degraded, but were "the
 best possible scans" (according to the technologist's note).

 FINDINGS:  The study is compared with the significantly motion-degraded
 non-enhanced MR examination of the lumbar spine, obtained the preceding day.

 Allowing for the motion artifact, the craniocervical junction is unremarkable
 and the spinal cord is normal in caliber and intrinsic signal intensity

 (Cont)
 through the conus medullaris, which is normal in morphology and intrinsic
 signal intensity and terminates at the T12-L1 level.  Specifically, there is
 no focal signal abnormality within the anterior or central cord substance to
 specifically suggest acute spinal cord infarction, and there is no evidence of
 intramedullary hemorrhage.  The spinal canal is quite capacious, with no
 evident stenosis, and again, allowing for the accentuated CSF-pulsation
 artifacts, there is no finding to suggest spinal epidural or subdural hematoma
 or mass effect upon the thoracic spinal cord.  There is only relatively mild
 disc degeneration with bulging in both the cervical and thoracic spine, with
 no significant cord contact or deformity. The vertebrae are normal in height,
 signal intensity, and alignment, with no vertebral bone marrow or
 paravertebral soft tissue edema.

 The rather limited imaging of the thoracoabdominal aorta demonstrates normal
 vascular caliber and contour, with no focal aneurysmal dilatation, through the
 level of the iliac bifurcation; specifically, there is a normal vascular
 flow-void on the T2-weighted sequences, with no finding to specifically
 suggest aortic thrombosis/occlusion.

 IMPRESSION:  Study is somewhat limited by persistent patient motion artifact,
 as well as the lack of diffusion-weighted sequence, with:

 1.  No finding to specifically suggest anterior spinal cord infarction.
 2.  No evidence of acute spinal epidural or subdural hematoma, or other cord
 compressive process.
 3.  Widely capacious spinal canal.
 4.  Grossly unremarkable appearance to the thoracoabdominal aorta, with no
 focal aneurysmal dilatation or evidence of occlusion or significant stenosis.

 INDICATION:  57-year-old female with myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis
 with increasing white blood cell count and shock.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images of the abdomen and pelvis are acquired
 with multiplanar reformatted images also submitted for review.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  The lung bases reveal small bilateral pleural
 effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.  Atherosclerotic coronary
 calcifications are partially imaged.  There is no evidence for pericardial
 effusion.

 Limited non-contrast evaluation of the liver, spleen and adrenal glands is
 unremarkable. The pancreas demonstrates fatty atrophy but is otherwise
 unremarkable. Contrast from recent intravenous administration persists within
 the kidneys and renal collecting system, which are enhanced symmetrically
 without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  A nasoenteric tube terminates in the
 duodenum. Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of normal caliber
 and there is no pneumoperitoneum.  Mild ascites is noted, predominantly
 perihepatically and perisplenically.  There are no pathologically enlarged
 mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  Severe atherosclerotic
 calcifications involve a hypoplastic aorta.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon is unremarkable.  The
 uterus is unremarkable.  The bladder contains a Foley and non-dependent air. A
 small amount of free pelvic fluid is noted.

 Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.  Diffuse
 subcutaneous edema is identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No focal fluid collection or abscess identified.
 2.  Anasarca with bilateral small pleural effusions and small ascites.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  57-year-old female with renal failure on hemodialysis.  Request
 to tunnel indwelling temporary left IJ hemodialysis catheter.

 OPERATORS:  The procedure was performed by doctors [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 896**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
 [**Doctor Last Name 90**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 90**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervised
 throughout the entire procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 300 mcg of fentanyl throughout the total intraservice time of 1 hour 30
 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously
 monitored.

 PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as conscious
 sedation were explained to the [**Hospital 353**] healthcare proxy, informed consent
 was obtained.  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed
 supine on the imaging table.  The indwelling left IJ hemodialysis catheter and
 upper left chest were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A
 preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.  A
 fluoroscopic spot image of the chest was obtained, demonstrating the tip of a
 temporary left IJ hemodialysis catheter terminating in the right atrium.  A
 tracheostomy tube was seen with its tip in standard position above the carina.
 First, attention was paid towards creation of a subcutaneous tract.
 Appropriate measurements were made and the subcutaneous soft tissues were
 anesthetized with epinephrine and buffered lidocaine.  A small incision was
 made and a 19 cm tip-to-cuff hemodialysis catheter was tunneled through the
 left chest wall subcutaneous tissue.  The indwelling catheter was then
 aspirated and all heparin was removed.  Next, a Glidewire was advanced through
 the indwelling lumen into the IVC.  The existing line was removed over the
 wire and a sheath/dilator device was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into
 the SVC.  The wire and dilator device were then removed and the dual lumen
 dialysis catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath.  A postprocedural
 radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with
 both tips in the right atrium.  The skin [**Doctor Last Name 695**] near the left internal jugular
 access entry point was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter was secured
 to the skin with 2-0 silk sutures.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The
 patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post-procedural
 complication.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful conversion of an existing left internal jugular

 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Acute STEMI with hypertensive cardiogenic shock, draining
 out bile from her NG suction.  Evaluate NG tube placement.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

 NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, but is likely in the duodenum
 given the fact that the sideport projects in the right upper quadrant and
 there is looping of the NG tube at this level.  ET tube is in the standard
 position.  Right IJ catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter remains in place.  There
 are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Right lower lobe opacity has improved consistent with improved atelectasis.
 Left retrocardiac opacity has improved consistent with improved atelectasis.
 Right upper lobe aeration has also improved.  There is mild vascular
 congestion.

 INDICATION:  Sharp respiratory failure, placed double-lumen PowerPICC and
 temporary dialysis line with VIP port in the left IJ.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 731**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7683**] [**Name (STitle) 7684**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**].

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
 brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
 micropuncture set.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and
 immediately after establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was
 then placed over guidewire and a double-lumen PowerPICC line measuring 40 cm
 in length was placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in
 the SVC under direct fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was
 confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.  The peel- away sheath and
 the guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was secured to the skin,
 flushed, and sterile dressing applied.

 TEMPORARY HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT:  After explaining the risks and
 benefits of the procedure and the alternatives, a written informed consent was
 obtained.  A preprocedure timeout confirming the patient's identity, nature of
 the procedure, and site was performed.  The left side of the neck and the left
 chest wall were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. Under
 ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was punctured with a
 micropuncture needle.  Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained
 documenting vessel patency.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through the needle
 and exchanged for a microcatheter which turn was upsized to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66**] wire.  The
 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The
 micropuncture sheath was removed and the tract dilated 7 French dilator.  A
 triple-lumen non-tunneled 16 cm 12 French double-lumen hemodialysis catheter
 was placed with the tip terminating within the right atrium under direct
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire was then removed.  All three ports of
 the new line were aspirated and flushed easily.  The catheter was anchored to
 the skin with 0 silk sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well without immediate post-procedure complication.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  After application of lidocaine jelly to the
                                                             (Over)

 nostrils, an 8 [**Location (un) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] tube was advanced through the nares into the
 esophagus and further into the stomach. Under direct fluoroscopic
 visualization, it was advanced across the ligament of Treitz into the proximal
 portion of the jejunum.  The tip of the tube positioning was confirmed after
 administration of contrast.  Small amount of air was injected to distend the
 stomach and the duodenum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There
 were no immediate post-procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Uncomplicated successful placement of the right-sided double-lumen PICC
 with internal catheter length of 40 cm and tip terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.
 2.  Successful placement of a non-tunneled triple-lumen central venous
 catheter with VIP port through the left IJ access with tip terminating within
 the right atrium. The line is ready to use.
 3.  Successful placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube with tip terminating

 Comparison is made to prior study performed a day before.

 ET tube tip is 2 cm above the carina.  Swan Ganz catheter tip is in the pain
 pulmonary artery.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.  Right IJ
 catheter tip is in the SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Small to
 moderate right pleural effusion has increased in amount.  There are low lung
 volumes.  Cardiac size is top normal.  There is atelectasis in the right base.

 Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe is more conspicuous.  This could
 be due to atelectasis, but infectious causes cannot be totally excluded.  Left
 lower lobe retrocardiac opacity in new and likely a combination of atelectasis
 and small left pleural effusion.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**11-7**], the nasogastric tube has been
 removed and replaced with a Dobbhoff tube.  It is unclear whether the tube
 extends to the fourth portion of the duodenum or merely coils on itself and
 has the tip in the body of the stomach.  On a repeat study showing the full
 extent of the bottom of the tube, this differentiation could be made.

 The lungs are essentially clear at this time except for some atelectatic
 streaks in the right mid zone.

 <NTE> CCU COURSE OF EVENTS/ SUMMARY:
   57 yr old female tnsf from [**Hospital6 **] to [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 3. Initially
   admitted  to OSH w c/o  ha, sore throat and epi Cath @ [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**]
   showed 70% RCA w good flow. Diffuse LM and LAD dx, with LAD suspected
   as culprit lesion. During intervention of her LAD pt became hypotensive
   and bradycardic. She was intubated, received atropine, epi and a temp
   wirer was placed in her R fem,  started on pressors.  Pt  received 1
   BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal LAD. IABP placed and pt
   transfered to CCU. Baseline creat is 1.3, but  bumped to 3.0-3.5, as
   did K+ to 5.5- so, CRRT was started shortly after admission w goal
   of      (-)1200cc/day.
   10/24 days-Hct drifted down to a low of 22 and pt was transfused w 2
   PRBC with an appropriate bump in Hct to high 20
s. CO/CI/SVR were in nl
   limits on /IABP. .
   On [**10-23**] days. L leg and ft mottled w loss of pulses and a new blister
   was noted on LLE.  . IABP d/cd  pulses DP returned but absent PT. L
   calf concerning for compartment syndrome. To OR for compartment
   fasiotomies. Received 1 u prbc in OR. #2 prbc in CCU overnoc.
   [**10-23**] 2200:  Restarted on CRRT   d/t concerns for RABDO (CK 90,000 on
   morning labs, ^ from 48,000 initial post-op)  goal to keep even.  Wound
   vac inserted early am and d/c [**10-26**] d/t constant clotting off. Primary
   dsg w kerlix and softsorb in place for reinforcement.
   [**10-25**].Wound bleeding and 2 u PRBCs given early [**10-26**], then again [**10-27**]
   with multiple NS boluses to increase PCW/ filling pressures.  Remains
   on Levo and added vasopressin w improvement in hemodynamics [**10-26**]
   afternoon.
   [**10-27**]: Weaned off Vasopressin-tolerated well. Receiving repeated
   transfusions for dropping of Hct in setting of constant leakage/ooze of
   serosang from large left leg wound.
   Misc:   GI: Pt  has bowel sounds and small amt G- bile in her stomach.
   She started tube feeding  afternoon [**10-27**]
no issues, tolerating.
               ID: Pt Afebrile, on bair  hugger  with temp 36-37C. However
   her WBCs are climbing- currently 34. She was pan cultured and has
   started vancomycin and cefepime IV [**10-27**].
               ENDO: She continues on insulin drip.
               RESP: Pt remains Intubated on AC 500 X 18-50% / 5 PEEP-no
   spontaneous breaths/minimal secretions/ sx.
               MS: Pt on lower doses of sedation-Fentanyl/Versed- with no
   increase in mental status- not moving extremities. (For a time she
   would open her eyes to suctioning, but now she is so edematous she
   cannot open her eyes.)
                SOCIAL: She has 2 daughters and a son, all of whom have
   been to visit, as well as multiple other family members. They have been
   told of pts very guarded prognosis.
   CURRENT PROBLEMS/ PROGRESS:
   Shock, cardiogenic
   Assessment:
   Pt s/p CV shock/MI requiring pressors/IABP/ETT currently remains on
   multiple supports on CRRT , s/p Faschiotomy for compartment syndrome
   r/t IABP placement.
   Action:
   Pt weaned off Vasopressin earlier- attempting to wean down levo gtt.
   Currently on 0.04 mcg Levo. MAPS remain > 60- BP- 115-151/41-43.
   CO/CI/SVR - 4.6/2.4/827- remains close to recent baseline). Pt remains
   intubated on 50-500-18, 5 PEEP. Sx for minimal thick tannish sputum.
   Groin sites clean/ pulses present. Repleting K/ Ca via CRRT protocol.
   Continuing to keep pt (+) and just dialyzing w CRRT d/t large
   loss/hypovolemia w bleeding oozing leg wound. Remains on tube feeds/
   insulin gtt- see flowsheet for adjustments to insulin dosage overnite.
   Minimal GI aspirates, no stool , hypoactive bowel sounds. Pt remains
   sedate on vent support on 0.5 versed/50 fentanyl.
   Response:
   Pt tolerating weaning of levo and weaning off of vasopressin. Continues
   w adequate Co/CI/ SVR. CRRT remains functional without evidence of
   increase in filter clotting off Heparin gtt. Continues to have stable
   respiratory status on current vent settings.
   Plan:
   Continue close assessment of hemodynamics- attempt to wean off levo as
   pt hopefully becomes less hypovolemic and wound starts leaking less.
   Continue to monitor CO/CI/SVR. Preload boluses w NS/ PRBC as PA numbers
   indicate and pt
s Hct dictates. Keep pt comfortable on current invasive
   therapy w current sedation meds. Keep pt
s family aware of plan of care
   and progress DAILY.

   She started tube feeding  afternoon [**10-27**]
no issues, tolerating.
               ID: Pt Afebrile, on bair  hugger  with temp 36-37C. However
   her WBCs are climbing- currently 34. She was pan cultured and has
   started vancomycin and cefepime IV [**10-27**].
               ENDO: She continues on insulin drip.
               RESP: Pt remains Intubated on AC 500 X 18-50% / 5 PEEP-no
   spontaneous breaths/minimal secretions/ sx.
               MS: Pt on lower doses of sedation-Fentanyl/Versed- with no
   increase in mental status- not moving extremities. (For a time she
   would open her eyes to suctioning, but now she is so edematous she
   cannot open her eyes.)

   57 yr old female tnsf from [**Hospital6 **] to [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 3. Initially
   admitted  to OSH w c/o  ha, sore throat and epi Cath @ [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**]
   showed 70% RCA w good flow. Diffuse LM and LAD dx, with LAD suspected
   as culprit lesion. During intervention of her LAD pt became hypotensive
   and bradycardic. She was intubated, received atropine, epi and a temp
   wirer was placed in her R fem,  started on pressors.  Pt  received 1
   BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal LAD. IABP placed and pt
   transfered to CCU. Baseline creat is 1.3, but  bumped to 3.0-3.5, as
   did K+ to 5.5- so, CRRT was started shortly after admission w goal
   of      (-)1200cc/day.
   10/24 days-Hct drifted down to a low of 22 and pt was transfused w 2
   PRBC with an appropriate bump in Hct to high 20
s. CO/CI/SVR were in nl
   limits on /IABP. .
   On [**10-23**] days. L leg and ft mottled w loss of pulses and a new blister
   was noted on LLE.  . IABP d/cd  pulses DP returned but absent PT. L
   calf concerning for compartment syndrome. To OR for compartment
   fasiotomies. Received 1 u prbc in OR. #2 prbc in CCU overnoc.
   [**10-23**] 2200:  Restarted on CRRT   d/t concerns for RABDO (CK 90,000 on
   morning labs, ^ from 48,000 initial post-op)  goal to keep even.  Wound
   vac inserted early am and d/c [**10-26**] d/t constant clotting off. Primary
   dsg w kerlix and softsorb in place for reinforcement.
   [**10-25**].Wound bleeding and 2 u PRBCs given early [**10-26**], then again [**10-27**]
   with multiple NS boluses to increase PCW/ filling pressures.  Remains
   on Levo and added vasopressin w improvement in hemodynamics [**10-26**]
   afternoon.
   [**10-27**]: Weaned off Vasopressin-tolerated well. Receiving repeated
   transfusions for dropping of Hct in setting of constant leakage/ooze of
   serosang from large left leg wound.

   Impaired Skin Integrity
   Assessment:
   The wound Vac in fasciotomy sites continued to clot off due to so much
   blood coming from site. The mepelix over the coccyx deep tissure injury
   remains in tact. Her skin folds have some purple looking areas. The
   deep tissure injury on L buttock remains unchanged. Her anasarca is
   worsening.
   Action:
   The L fasciotomy site is now a wet to dry dsg that soaks through
   quickly. It has soft sorb pads under it. Vasc has changed X 2 today and
   it has been re-inforced.  Crit is being followed and continues to drop.
   It went  down to 26.8 this afternoon (31.5 after 2 units overnight).

   bacteria.
 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transferred to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission. On [**10-23**] pulses
   lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment syndrome and she went
   to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO but has required long term HD and had
   tunneled HD catheter placed [**11-22**].
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR and had further de-bridment of L lower leg with
   placement of wound vac.  The de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg
   was also debrided, though it is much more shallow  Plastics has been
   consulted . . Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube .
   [**11-22**]:  Dobhoff placed for feeding as thoracic surgery felt a PEG tube
   placement would not heal while so malnourished, low albumin and glucose
   issues. Pt  now off ventilator on trach mask, but unable to use
   passy-muir.
   [**2102-11-23**]: Fever on [**11-23**] am. Plastic and vascular surgery to consult
   and look at faschiotomy sites and wound VAC removed and wet to dry dsgs
   using dakons sltn. Lots of bleeding at site.
   [**2104-11-25**]: Problems with bloody secretions and de-sating, resoved over
   24hrs. Albuterol added for occasional wheezing. New pressure areas on
   occiput found. Area cleansed. Foam head cradle now being used as
   pillow.  Now tolerating passy-muir. Sputum positive klebsiella, yeast
   and stenotrophomonas. She was placed on contact precautions for later
   bacteria.
   [**11-29**]: Wound vac inserted in lateral wound.
   [**12-1**] Pt went to OR for further debridment of wound. She returned with
   wound vac in place in upper wound and L lower leg covered with ace
   wrap. Blood leaking through upon arrival.  She had 600cc EBL in OR and
   1200cc in. She required multiple doses of bolus neosynephrine and came
   up on a drip. BP initially in the 60-70s, though pt responding. Neo
   increased to 1mg transiently and she received a 500 NS bolus. BP up
   quickly and neo decreased to .5 mic/kilo. Neo was later increased to
   .6mic/kilo where it remains.  ID: low grade temp in am, received
   Tylenol. She conts on bactrim and fluconizole.  GI:  NPO for OR.
   Minimal stool through flexiseal. Bridal placed to keep NG tube in
   place. Tube feedings of nutren pulmonary with 20gm beneprotein
   restarted.  RESP: Pt stable on 40% trach mask. PMV not used today as
   she went to OR.  She was briefly on vent in OR but on mask prior to
   returning to CCU.  ENDO: Pt received 4 units reg insulin at 1500 and no
   further ss insulin required.   SOCIAL: Plan for family meeting [**12-2**]
   with as many of the various teams involved as possible to discuss
   present goals.
   Impaired Skin Integrity
   Assessment:
   Pt has multiple lesions. Her buttock, especially L side has DTI being
   treated with vigilon and soft sorb dsg. She has in tact mepilex on L
   arm. She has 2 small pressure areas on occiput . Buttock and groin area
   covered with vigilon and softsorb pads. She left for OR at 1140 with
   wound vac in place at 125mm/hg. It is draining minimal fluid.
   Action:
   Pts position changes Q 2 hrs. She has flexiseal in place with tube
   covered with xeroform gauze to prevent fecal drainage off fragile
   skin.Head remains either on bed or on foam head cradle.  Pt returned
   from OR at 1345 with new wound vac that plastics says in on upper
   wound. Wound dsg saturated and draining blood and plastics notified.
   Post OR crit sent which was 25.1. Dsgs on buttock and groin area
   changed.
   Response:
   Plastic does not want dsg changed. They will come to see it later
   today. No new lesions.
   Plan:

   lateral leg dsg to start tomorrow.
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
   Pt remains oliguric with minimal urine output. Lytes and pH remain
   stable. Pt received HD this am prior to going to the OR.  She received
   1 U PRBCs with the treatment.. At the onset of HD her BP dropped to the
   70s. She denied feeling lightheaded or uncomfortable with this.
   Action:
   She was initially given fluid by HD nurse, then she received the blood.
   Response:
   BP stabilized after blood was received. Nurse was able to remove all
   she received during HD plus another 500 ccs. However due to boluses
   post OR she is now ~700cc positive for the day. She is still sating
   98-100%/

   Motor Function, Impaired
   Assessment:
   Pt has not moved her lower extremities since admission. She does
   receive passive  ROM to the R lower extremity. She moves both upper
   extremities easily over her head and in a wide range. Her hands are
   mitted as she has pulled  out feeding tube a number of times. She is
   able to move her trunk some to reposition herself. She has foot drop of
   L foot. R hand has very limited range of motion and is painful when her
   fingers or flattened.
   Action:
   She had MRI [**11-29**] which showed she did not have a spinal infarct. She
   receives frequent position changes. She is assessed regularly in
   Spanish to get her to attempts to move lower extremities. ROM done to R
   hand and R leg. Will ;consult PT about ?hand contracture. L leg in
   multipodis for positioning of foot drop
   Response:
   For the first time today very slight movement was seen on command to R

 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transferred to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission. On [**10-23**] pulses
   lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment syndrome and she went
   to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistent renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   fasciotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD , now that she is off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridement. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of
   pressor( Neo).

   She  continued  on CRRT   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid
   goal to keep even, but has continued due to persisten renal failue and
   will likely need long term HD.  Wound vac inserted by surgery. She
   remained presser dependent until [**11-18**].
   CV: She is now hemodynamically stable, tolerating HD. She started
   lopressor [**11-20**] and tolerated it.
   GI: She has been on tube feedings at goal.  She has fllexiseal in place
   draining G+ green/brown liquid stool.

   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of

   couple of days.
   [**11-22**]:  Weaned off Neo and new tunnelled IJ Dialysis line placed and

   continued to need HD due to have persistant renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   faschiotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD last wk- once her hemodynamics became more
   stable/off pressors.

 <NTE> Pt has been breathing on her own and managing well with passy muir
   valve during the day and off at night. 02 sats 100 percent on 40
   percent face mask or room air ( when pt removes trach collar).  She is
   coughing up clear to white sputum and at times requires some  light (
   not deep) suction to help her expectorate.  She has been more convesent
   lately and is able to make her needs known. MRI was negative for spinal
   process and per report pt did move RLE to command slightly.
   Yesterday pt went to OR  yesterday afternoon for vac change to LLE and
   debridement of fasciotomy wound.  Pt has lost blood from OR and post
   dressing saturated ( reinforce per plastics do not change, they will
   change the dressin), reinforced with sorbsan. Less oozing overnight. Pt

 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt  received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transfered to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission .
   On [**10-23**] days pulses lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment
   syndrome and she went to  OR for fasciotomies.
   She  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and  initially d/t concerns for
   RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has continued due to have
   persistant renal failure and will likely need long term HD.  Wound vac
   was inserted by surgery at site of faschiotomies. She remained pressor
   dependent until [**11-18**] and was able to wean to trach collar from vent
   support x 72 hrs ago. She has also transitioned from CRRT to HD once
   her hemodynamics became more stable/off pressors.
   [**11-21**]  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridment. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. They were not able to place the PEG tube [**11-22**].
   Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of pressor(
   Neo). It is planned to reattempt both procedures in the next couple of
   days. Weaned off Neo and new tunnelled IJ Dialysis line placed and
   dobhoff placed for feeding as thoracic surgery felt a PEG tube
   placement would not heal while so malnourished, low albumin and glucose
   issues.

   CCU. She was intubated on pressers.  CRRT was started shortly after
   admission .
   On [**10-23**] days. L leg and ft mottled w loss of pulses &. IABP d/cd
   pulses DP returned but absent PT. L  leg developed compartment syndrome
   and she went to  OR for fasiotomies. She required transfusions and has
   persisten low crits and is receiving epo.
   She has continued  on CRRT   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with
   fluid  goal to keep even, but has continued due to persisten renal
   failue and will likely need long term HD.  Wound vac inserted by
   surgery. She had had very high WBCs in late [**Month (only) **].  which have come down,
   but picture continues to appear as distributive shock and she remains
   on neo, and multiple wounds on leg, buttock  are worsening.

   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   Assessment:
   Pt has remained on trach mask at 50% with RR 22-28. She states
   breathing is comfortable. She is sating 100%. She continues to have
   course BS throughout. She has strong non-productive cough.
   Action:
   Speech and swallow evaluated for passey-muir valve. She was able to say
   a few words with Spanish interpreter present, but felt she was not able
   to breathe well with valve in place. She is also quite lethargic today,
   though the only sedation is a fentanyl patch. She continues to be
   turned Q 2 hrs and VAP protocol is being followed.
   Response:
   She has remained on trach mask with good oxygenation.
   Plan:
   Continue with position changes, encourage coughing and deep breathing
   and monitor sats. Send venous gas in am.
   Impaired Skin Integrity
   Assessment:
   Pt has well documented multiple skin lesions. The wound vac remains in
   place with suction at 125mg/hg and minimal drainage. . She has a
   deroofed blister on the Left calf and multiple lesions on her L
   buttock and coccyx/perianal area. She has flexiseal to prevent stool
   leakage onto damaged skin. She has an number of other small lesions as
   a result of trauma to edematous skin.
   Action:
   Dsgs to L calf and buttock/coccyx/peri-anal area changed. They were
   cleaned with wound cleanser, and dried. Criticade clear was applied to
   peri-wound tissue and xeroform covered lesions. There was no purulent
   drainage and edged appeared to be granulating. Her heels are kept
   elevated with waffle boots and pillows. She remains on air-bed and
   position is changed Q 2 hrs. ID consulted and examined all of pts
   wound. They felt an MRI of L leg (which had been ordered) would have
   been of very low yield and it was cancelled.
   Response:
   No new lesions seen.
   Plan:
   Continue with skin care as ordered. Monitor for changes. Change
   position Q 2 hr.
   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
   Pts BUN/creat continue to slow climb to 26.2.9. Electrolytes are within
   nl limits and pt is not acidotic. She remiains oliguric with urine
   output ranging 5-10cc/hr. She is sating well and does not have signs of
   respiratory compromise due to low urine output.
   Action:
   There is no indication for dialysis today. She will be re-evaluated
   tomorrow and may receive either CVVHD or HD. She has received 1500cc in
   fluid boluses today and urine output remains at ~5-10cc/hr.
   Response:
   Pt is 2670cc positive for the day thus far and >1550cc pos LOS
   Plan:
   ? HD or CVVHD tomorrow. Monitor I & O closely
   Shock, distributive.
   Assessment:
   Pt remains presser dependent. She has remained on neo at 1.3 mic/kilo
   over the past few days. BP has been in low 100s. At 0800 BP was up to
   130s. She is afebrile. Vanco held today as level was 40. She continues
   on zosyn and fluconizole.
   Action:
   Neo was decreased to 1.1 mic/kilo at 0800. It was decided to give her a
   500cc NS bolus as well as. She received to bolus at 0900. She may get
   CT of abdomen per ID recommendations. By afternoon bp was in low 90s
   and occasionally dipped into the 80s.  Neo was increased to
   1.1mic/kilo  and she received an additional liter of NS. Stool sent for
   C-diff. She put out ~600cc of liquid stool today.
   Response:
   Pts bp did not respond to fluid bolus and bp has not tolerated any
   decrease in present neo dose. She remains on 1.1mic/kilo of neo with
   bps in 90s to low 100s.
   Plan:
   Titrate neo as tolerated. Monitor for fever or elevated WBC.
 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt  received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transfered to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission .
   On [**10-23**] days pulses lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment
   syndrome and she went to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistant renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   faschiotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD last wk- once her hemodynamics became more
   stable/off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridment. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of
   pressor( Neo). It is planned to reattempt both procedures in the next
   couple of days.
   [**11-22**]:  Weaned off Neo and new tunnelled IJ Dialysis line placed and
   Dobhoff placed for feeding as thoracic surgery felt a PEG tube
   placement would not heal while so malnourished, low albumin and glucose
   issues. Plan is for vascular and plastics to meet at early AM rounds to
   inspect faschiotomy wounds and discuss a care plan.
   [**11-23**]: Plastic and vascular surgery to consult and look at faschiotomy
   sites with wound vac removed to discuss plan of care.

   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)
   Assessment:
   Pt has been off CVVVHD for over 24hr. Dialysis was stopped as pt was
   hemodynamically unstable and had required multiple fluid boluses over
   the weekend.  Urine output is ~5cc hr of amber, cloudy urine. Lytes are
   all within nl limits. BUN/creat 14/2.0 today, 7/ 1.0 [**11-14**]. Bicarb 19.
   Action:
   Hourly urine outputs documented. She is ~700cc  positive today despite
   1 liter of liquid stool out, and over 12 liters pos LOS.
   Plan:
   Renal consulting and she will receive either HD, or resume CVVHD
   tomorrow. Monitor lytes and renal function.
   Shock, other
   Assessment:
   Pt remains on neosynephrine at 1.3 mic/kilo. Any attempts at decreasing
   dose result in hypotension. On this dose BP has been stable in low
   100s. HR in 1-teens with fever in am, down to high 90s to low 100s
   after Tylenol brought fever down. WBCs 12.7 today, up slightly. She
   continues on multiple ABXs. Culture from a-line + for strep, other
   cultures negative. Source of fever unclear, though the leg wounds are
   looking worse, as is the buttock perineal area.
   Action:
   She continues to receive ABX as ordered. Vascular called to again look
   at leg and other wounds for possible debridment or other treatment.
   Response:
   BP stable on present dose of neo.
   Plan:
   Wean neo as tolerated. Continue with ABX as ordered. Send vanco level
   in am.

   Assessment:
   Pts respiratory status has improved. She spent the night on CPAP 5/5
   40% overnight with sats in the 100 and RR in 20s. She does not appear
   dyspnic. She has strong, non-productive cough. She has course breath
   sounds, clearer in the afternoon.
   Action:
   She has gone on trach mask for ~3 hours in am and another couple hours
   in the afternoon. She continues to appear comfortable with RR 18-22.
   Blood gas and new a-line was attempted, but they were unable to get
   either blood or line into pt. VAP protocol followed.
   Response:
   Resting comfortably on CPAP 5/5 40%.
   Plan:
   Send venous gas with am labs. Monitor for change in resp status.
   Continue to work on trach mask, perhaps another few hours tonight.
 <NTE> Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I
   Assessment:
   Pt did not receive any glargine last night as she was NPO and had been
   profoundly hypoglycemic in am of [**11-20**] (21).
   Action:
   Sugar prior to going to the OR was 121. Since returning sugars have
   been 92 to 99..Tube feedings have been restarted. She received dose of
   10 units lantis at 1830.
   Plan:
   Check finger sticks Q 2 hrs until sure pt is not hypoglycemic.
   57 yr old female wo  @ [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with STEMI. Pt  received 1 BMS to
   her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal LAD. IABP placed and pt transfered to
   CCU. She was intubated on pressers.  CRRT was started shortly after
   admission .
   On [**10-23**] days pulses lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment
   syndrome and she went to  OR for fasciotomies.
   She  continued  on CRRT   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid
   goal to keep even, but has continued due to persisten renal failure and
   will likely need long term HD.  Wound vac inserted by surgery. She
   remained presser dependent until [**11-18**].
   [**11-21**]  She went to OR at 1100 for closure of fasciotomy and placement
   of PEG tube.  They were not able to close the wounds and both needed
   further de-breedment. They were debreeded and wound vac placed in each.
   The de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debreeded,
   though it is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with
   estimated blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about
   closing the wound later this week. They were not able to place the PEG
   tube and it will have to be placed laproscopically later. She returned
   to CCU ~1315 intubated through trach on propofol at 50mic/kilo and
   neosynephrine at .7 mic/kilo.
   CV:  Neosynephrine post OR is being weaned off. She did not received
   lopressor this am or afternoon. Hr has been in 70-80s NSR with no
   ectopy. Neo was down to .2 mic/kilo but BP dropped to low 80s and she
   is back to .4mic/kilo.
   RESP: She is on CPAP 5 PEEP and 10 PS and 40%. She is breathing at
   22-30. Her venous gas was 7.35/48/32/28. She has decreased BS at bases,
   but is other wise clear.
   GI: She has been on tube feedings at goal.  She pulled out NG tube this
   am. In OR they were unable to place PEG and tube will have to be placed
   laproscopically at later time. After returning an NG tube was dropped
   and She has fllexiseal in place draining G+ green/brown liquid stool.
   Tube feedings were restarted at 1615. She had abdominal ultra-sound
   today.
   MS: Her  affect  had been  very flat and she only intermittently  is
   following commands in Spanish. She moves upper extremities freely but
   no movement seen in her legs.She was weaned off propofol at 1645 and is
   now opening her eyes, and following commands in Spanish. .   COMFORT:
   She nodded her head she had pain. New fentanyl patch applied. As she
   immediately goes to sleep when not stimulated. She can receive bolus
   fentanyl if she wakes up and c/o of pain. At 1800 she denied pain.
   HEME: Has had crits in mid 20s. Post OR crit was 31.5.
   Acute on chronic renal failure
   Assessment:
   Pt had HD in am prior to going to OR. She received 1 gm of vanco and
   dose of epogen.  500cc was removed. She tolerated HD well and remained
   hemodynamically stable throughout the run.
   Action:
   Afternoon labs drawn and BUN/creat now 14/1.5. Her K+ is 4.1. She is
   voiding small amts of urine, however she has put out over a liter of
   stool today.
   Plan:
   Continue to monitor lytes, kidney function and I &
   O
   Impaired Skin Integrity
   Assessment:
   Pt has multiple well documented skin lesions She went to OR today for
   debridment and closure of fasciotomies on L leg. Both wounds were
   debreeded, but then attached to black foam wound vacs. She returned
   paralyzed, on neosynephrine.  She has an in tact mepilex dsg on de-roof
   blister on L calf. Her buttocks/coccyx/gluteal area has mixed tissure
   base of grey and red tissue with some indication of granulation. She
   has small ulcerated area just distal to dialysis line that is drying
   and healing. She has small discolored areas on each heel that are in
   tact and appear to be shrinking in size. There are a number of small
   nicks and tears on skin surface which are healing.
   Action:
   Buttock/coccyx/gluteal dsg now is to wash area with wound cleanser and
   dry. Criticade applied to healthy tissue. Vigilon was applied to most
   of buttock area. Some  Xeroform was put around rectum and skin folds.
   Both wound vac have 125 mm/hg and are draining sanguiness fluid.
   Response:
   Skin now dryer and there seems to be some improvement.
   Plan:
   Continue with frequent turns. Change dsg Q shift or when soiled.
 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transferred to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission. On [**10-23**] pulses
   lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment syndrome and she went
   to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistent renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   fasciotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD , now that she is off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridement. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated

 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt  received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transfered to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission .
   On [**10-23**] days pulses lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment
   syndrome and she went to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistant renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   faschiotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD last wk- once her hemodynamics became more
   stable/off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridment. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of
   pressor( Neo). It is planned to reattempt both procedures in the next
   couple of days.
   [**11-22**]:  Weaned off Neo and new tunnelled IJ Dialysis line placed and
   Dobhoff placed for feeding as thoracic surgery felt a PEG tube
   placement would not heal while so malnourished, low albumin and glucose
   issues. Plan is for vascular and plastics to meet at early AM rounds to
   inspect faschiotomy wounds and discuss a care plan.
   [**11-23**]: Plastic and vascular surgery to consult and look at faschiotomy
   sites with wound vac removed to discuss plan of care.

 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with
   STEMI/CV shock. Pt received 1 BMS to her LMCA and 2 BMS to her distal
   LAD. IABP placed and pt transferred to CCU. She was intubated on
   pressors.  CRRT was started shortly after admission.
   On [**10-23**] days pulses lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment
   syndrome and she went to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistent renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   fasciotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD last wk- once her hemodynamics became more
   stable/off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridement. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of
   pressor( Neo). It is planned to reattempt both procedures in the next
   couple of days.
   [**11-22**]:  Weaned off Neo and new tunnelled IJ Dialysis line placed and
   Dobhoff placed for feeding as thoracic surgery felt a PEG tube
   placement would not heal while so malnourished, low albumin and glucose
   issues. Plan is for vascular and plastics to meet at early AM rounds to
   inspect faschiotomy wounds and discuss a care plan.
   [**11-23**]: Plastic and vascular surgery to consult and look at faschiotomy
   sites with wound vac removed to discuss plan of care.

 <NTE> This is a 57 yr old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**10-21**] with

   lost &. IABP d/cd . L  leg developed compartment syndrome and she went
   to  OR for fasciotomies.
   Overall during CCU course-pt  continued  on CRRT for renal fx and
   initially d/t concerns for RABDO with fluid  goal to keep even, but has
   continued to need HD due to have persistent renal failure and will
   likely need it long term.  Wound vac was inserted by surgery at site of
   fasciotomies. She remained pressor dependent until [**11-18**] and was able
   to wean to trach collar from vent support x 96 hrs ago. She has also
   transitioned from CRRT to HD , now that she is off pressors.
   [**11-21**] Pt  to OR at 1100 for closure of faschiotomy and placement of PEG
   tube- both attempts were not successful.
    They were not able to close the wounds and both needed further
   debridement. They were debrided and wound vac placed in each. The
   de-roofed blister on the calf of that leg was also debrided, though it
   is much more shallow. She received 2 units PRBCs in OR with estimated
   blood loss of 700cc.  Plastics has been consulted about closing the
   wound later this week. Also, surgery was not able to place the PEG tube
   . Pt returned to CCU on vent support and requiring small amt of
   pressor( Neo).

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Progressive improvement is hindered by need to have sedation
   restarted regularly [**1-31**] dysynchrony with her vent
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   - continue to wean sedation (on fentanyl and versed) as tolerated
   (patient gets agitated and hrt increases)
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need; net
   goal -2L today
   - CK daily
 464 yesterday
   - continue pressure support on neo(phenylephedrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - tolerated 10 hours of  pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate respiratory efforts.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, cont lactulose
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr-attempting to increase
   - PEG placement
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), CVVH line needs
   to be changed.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   - obtain IR-guided PICC this AM when she gets tunneled cath, pull
   triple-lumen at that time
   .
   # ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative.  Bumped to 27 o/n, down to 24 this AM.  Patient with
   multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, which both need
   resiting, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX, Glucan, Galactomanan, C.
   Diff, vanco lvl
   - will consider adding meropenem +/- cipro for Pseudomonas cx if
   cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D12), vanc (since [**10-26**],
   currently D12), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D10) of presumed 14day
   course
   - give diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - ID signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - H+H fell yesterday, suspect line manipulation as source, plts are
   rising
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR continues to rise or bleeding continues, goal
   INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Progressive improvement is hindered by need to have sedation
   restarted regularly [**1-31**] dysynchrony with her vent
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   - continue to wean sedation (on fentanyl and versed) as tolerated
   (patient gets agitated and hrt increases)
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need; net
   goal -2L today
   - CK daily
 464 yesterday
   - continue pressure support on neo(phenylephedrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - tolerated 10 hours of  pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate respiratory efforts.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, cont lactulose
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr-attempting to increase
   - PEG placement
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), CVVH line needs
   to be changed.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   - obtain IR-guided PICC this AM when she gets tunneled cath, pull
   triple-lumen at that time
   .
   # ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative.  Bumped to 27 o/n, down to 24 this AM.  Patient with
   multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, which both need
   resiting, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX, Glucan, Galactomanan, C.
   Diff, vanco lvl
   - will consider adding meropenem +/- cipro for Pseudomonas cx if
   cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D12), vanc (since [**10-26**],
   currently D12), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D10) of presumed 14day
   course
   - give diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - ID signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - H+H fell yesterday, suspect line manipulation as source, plts are
   rising
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR continues to rise or bleeding continues, goal
   INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Progressive improvement is hindered by need to have sedation
   restarted regularly [**1-31**] dysynchrony with her vent
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   - continue to wean sedation (on fentanyl and versed) as tolerated
   (patient gets agitated and hrt increases)
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need; net
   goal -2L today
   - CK daily
 464 yesterday
   - continue pressure support on neo(phenylephedrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - tolerated 10 hours of  pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate respiratory efforts.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, cont lactulose
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr-attempting to increase
   - PEG placement
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), CVVH line needs
   to be changed.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   - obtain IR-guided PICC this AM when she gets tunneled cath, pull
   triple-lumen at that time
   .
   # ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative.  Bumped to 27 o/n, down to 24 this AM.  Patient with
   multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, which both need
   resiting, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX, Glucan, Galactomanan, C.
   Diff, vanco lvl
   - will consider adding meropenem +/- cipro for Pseudomonas cx if
   cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D12), vanc (since [**10-26**],
   currently D12), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D10) of presumed 14day
   course
   - give diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - ID signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - H+H fell yesterday, suspect line manipulation as source, plts are
   rising
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR continues to rise or bleeding continues, goal
   INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   -    followed by Vsurg

   Comments:
   57 year old female with long, complicated hospital course, remains
   intub/sedated on CVVH for fluid removal.  Patient now with meleno
   stool, started on PPI drip, and tube feed held per GI.  Patient has
   been having minimal nutrition since admission (now almost 2 weeks),
   spoke to team, believed that ileus is resolved with lactulose, hope to
   restart tube feed tomorrow.  Highly recommend starting TPN while
   re-trial tube feed, patient is malnourished.  Noted trach placement
   discussion in progress due to prolonged intubation.
 <NTE> Subjective
   Trached, leaving to go to IR now.

   Obese, but at risk for malnutrition
   Patient at risk due to: NPO / hypocaloric diet
   Estimated Nutritional Needs
   Calories: 1200-1500 (BEE x  or / 20-25 cal/kg)
   Protein: 59-77 (1-1.3 g/kg)
   Fluid: per team
   Calculations based on: Adjusted weight
   Estimation of previous intake: appears Excessive
   Estimation of current intake: Inadequate as patient is NPO
   Specifics:
   57 year old female transferred from [**Hospital3 **] c/ STEMi, now c/
   caardiogenic shock.  Patient is intubated and sedated, on CVVH for ARF
   (likely d/t hypoperfusion).
   Nutrition consulted for tube feed recommendations.  RN just unclamped
   OGT and patient had ~60mL dark brown residuals.  Will need to monitor
   tolerance closely when initiating feeds.  Once tolerance established,
   will need to add beneprotien to feeds to better meet estimated
   nutrition needs.
   Patient on glargine and HISS for glucose management-may need to be
   adjusted once feeds started.
   Medical Nutrition Therapy Plan - Recommend the Following
          When starting feeds, recommend Novasource renal @10mL/hr to
   increase 10mL/ q4 hr to goal 25mL/hr (1200 kcals/44 gr protein)  Once
   patint is tolerating @ goal, can add 25 grams beneprotein (1289
   kcals/66 gr protein)
          Flush c/ 50 mL q6 hr
          Residual checks q4 hr, hold if >200mL
