PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: 50F hx of alcholic CM,  acute pancreatitis, and persistent resp distress.
Height: (in) 65
Weight (lb): 140
BSA (m2): 1.70 m2
BP (mm Hg): 185/80
HR (bpm): 96
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2155-1-17**] at 11:30
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2155-1-14**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Indeterminate LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic
function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. Estimated cardiac index is high
(>4.0L/min/m2).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate. The patient
appears to be in sinus rhythm. Compared with the findings of the prior study,
the findings are similar. Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular cavity size could not be determined. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2155-1-14**], the findings are
similar.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Biventricular hyperdynamic systolic
function.



PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: 50F hx of alcholic CM now w/ acute pancreatitis, resp failure, and hypotension.
Height: (in) 65
Weight (lb): 140
BSA (m2): 1.70 m2
BP (mm Hg): 125/68
HR (bpm): 110
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2155-1-14**] at 18:30
Test: Portable TTE (Focused views)
Doppler: Limited Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. The patient is mechanically
ventilated. Cannot assess RA pressure.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Indeterminate LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF
>75%. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Nl
interventricular septal motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No valvular AS. The increased
transaortic velocity is related to high cardiac output.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve leaflets not well seen. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal
image quality as the patient was difficult to position. Suboptimal image
quality - ventilator. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate.
Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular cavity size could not be
determined. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. Interventricular septal motion is normal. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity
is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets are not
well seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Hyperdynanic biventricular function
(LVEF>75%)

   Assessment and Plan
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES),
   PANCREATITIS, ACUTE, RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 50 yr old female with pancreatitis - intubated for
   airway protection after massive fluid resuscitation as well as history
   of EtOH use.
   .
   NEUROLOGIC: attempting to minimize sedation with a combination of
   midaz, fentanyl, and precedex while keeping patient calm enough for
   possible extubation; will wean sedation as tolerated today
   Neuro checks Q: 4
   Pain: well controlled on fentanyl
   CARDIOVASCULAR: Hemodynamically stable - not requiring additional BP
   meds at this time; will monitor closely for signs of withdrawl
   PULMONARY: Will titrate ventilator settings in preparation for
   extubation; minimizing sedation as possible while keeping pt.
   relatively calm; will undertake aggressive pulmonary toilet once
   extubated
   GI / ABD: pancreatitis with free fluid around pancrease but no evidence
   of infection/pseudocyst; attempted placement of [**Last Name (un) 1292**]-jejunal tube
   without success -> will f/u CXR from this am to see if single dose of
   reglan helped move tube post-pyloric; holding tube feeds while tube not
   in proper position; will call GI for possible advancement of feeding
   tube
   NUTRITION: NPO, see above
   RENAL: Cr stable and baseline; urine output adequate; getting one
   banana bag a day but otherwise KVO
   HEMATOLOGY: stable macrocyctic anemia, secondary to alchol use, will
   follow daily
   ENDOCRINE: RISS
   ID: completed course of antibiotcs at outside hospital
   LINES/TUBES/DRAINS: LTLC, A line, PIV, ETT, dobhoff
   WOUNDS: None
   IMAGING: CXR in AM, will get KUB because CXR did not adequately
   visualize dobhoff
   FLUIDS: banana bag x1L -> then KVO

   .
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 50 yr old female with pancreatitis - intubated for
   airway protection after massive fluid resuscitation as well as history
   of EtOH use.
   .
   NEUROLOGIC: attempting to minimize sedation with a combination of
   midaz, fentanyl, and precedex while keeping patient calm enough for
   possible extubation; will wean sedation as tolerated today
   Neuro checks Q: 4
   Pain: well controlled on fentanyl
   CARDIOVASCULAR: Hemodynamically stable - not requiring additional BP
   meds at this time; will monitor closely for signs of withdrawl
   PULMONARY: Will titrate ventilator settings in preparation for
   extubation; minimizing sedation as possible while keeping pt.
   relatively calm; will undertake aggressive pulmonary toilet once
   extubated
   GI / ABD: pancreatitis with free fluid around pancrease but no evidence
   of infection/pseudocyst; attempted placement of [**Last Name (un) 1292**]-jejunal tube
   without success -> will f/u CXR from this am to see if single dose of
   reglan helped move tube post-pyloric; holding tube feeds while tube not
   in proper position; will call GI for possible advancement of feeding
   tube
   NUTRITION: NPO, see above
   RENAL: Cr stable and baseline; urine output adequate; getting one
   banana bag a day but otherwise KVO
   HEMATOLOGY: stable macrocyctic anemia, secondary to alchol use, will
   follow daily

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with pancreatic inflammation.  Assess for change.

 COMPARISON:  There are no previous cross-sectional examinations for
 comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the abdomen were obtained without
 IV contrast.  Subsequently, following the administration of 130 cc of IV
 Optiray, contiguous axial images through the region of the pancreas were
 obtained in the arterial phase, and images through the entire abdomen were
 obtained in the portal venous phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
 were generated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  There is linear atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  A small epicardial lymph node measures 6 mm in the short
 (3B:74).  There is a 4-mm focus of hyperenhancement at the extreme dome of the
 liver seen in the portal venous phase images (3B:74).  Focal hypodensity
 adjacent to the portahepatis/left portal vein may represent focal fatty
 infiltration, spanning up to 2.2 cm (3B:87).  The portal vein remains patent.
 No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  The gallbladder is unremarkable. The
 spleen is not enlarged.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The kidneys
 enhance symmetrically and excrete normally.

 The pancreas is surrounded by fluid, in keeping with the given history of
 pancreatitis.  The pancreatic parenchyma appears thin particularly in the neck
 region, but the parenchyma continues to enhance homogeneously where it is
 seen.  Fluid anterior to the pancreas measures 15 mm in thickness, seen along
 the entire course of the pancreas, and fluid posterior to the pancreas
 measures about 11 mm in thickness.  Fluid insinuates between the pancreas and
 splenic vein, which is quite narrowed by the inflammatory process, though
 still patent.  A thin rim of enhancement surrounds the inflammatory fluid
 about the pancreas, and fluid and peritoneal enhancement extends into the left
 paracolic gutter, where fluid measures up to 7.2 x 3.2 cm in greatest axial
 dimensions.  The duodenum and proximal jejunum appear distended up to
 approximately 2.7 cm in diameter, possibly a focal ileus due to pancreatic
 inflammation.  Other visualized small bowel loops are nondilated and the
 imaged colon contains a moderate amount of stool.  A small amount of stranding
 extends into the right mid abdomen, into the right paracolic gutter.

 The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, with moderate atherosclerotic
 calcification.  The common hepatic as well as right and left hepatic arteries
 arise from the SMA.  An accessory left hepatic artery arises from the gastric
                                                             (Over)

 in the porta hepatis and portocaval regions, with the largest portocaval node
 measuring 2.5 x 1.1 cm, possibly reactive.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Pancreatitis, with a moderate-to-large amount of fluid surrounding the
 pancreas extending into the left paracolic gutter, thinning of the pancreatic
 parenchyma in the pancreatic neck region (without necrosis), and inflammatory
 fluid insinuating between the pancreas and splenic vein, markedly attenuating
 the vein.  The pancreatic parenchyma continues to enhance homogeneously where
 seen.  There may be focal ileus of the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum,
 related to inflammation.

 2.  Probable focal fatty infiltration in the liver near the portal vein, and
 tiny focus of enhancement at the hepatic dome, a nonspecific finding.
 Continued attention on followup studies to these areas is recommended.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST

 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen [**2155-2-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial imaging was performed from the lung bases through
 the mid abdomen without and with intravenous contrast.  Oral contrast was
 administered.  Sagittal and coronal reformats were obtained.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases demonstrate right basilar
 dependent atelectasis without masses, nodules or pleural effusions.  The
 partially visualized heart appears normal.

 The spleen, adrenals, gallbladder, and liver appear unremarkable.  The kidneys
 enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without stones, masses or
 hydronephrosis.

 Surrounding the body and tail of the pancreas on the contrast-enhanced phase
 is an area of low density, which may represent a small peripancreatic fluid
 collection or nonenhancing necrotic pancreatic tissue.  Compared to the prior
 examination, this area of peripancreatic low density has decreased. In the
 left paracolic gutter is a 3 x 1.5 cm fluid collection (2:22), which has
 decreased compared to the prior examination.  There is no free fluid and there
 is no free air in the abdomen.  Stomach and partially visualized loops of
 small and large bowel appear normal.  The abdominal aorta and its branches
 appear widely patent.  In particular, there is no thrombosis, or aneurysmal
 dilation of the splenic artery.  The splenic vein is widely patent. The common
 hepatic artery arises directly off the superior mesenteric artery. There is no
 pancreatic ductal dilation and there are no pancreatic calcifications.  No
 evidence for pseudocyst formation.  No lymphadenopathy is seen.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with
 unchanged compression deformity of mid thoracic vertebra with unchanged loss
 of intervertebral disc space height.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in size of peripancreatic hypodensity, which may reflect
 a small amount of peripancreatic fluid or hypoattenuating necrotic pancreatic
 tissue.
 2.  No evident complications associated with pancreatitis including no
 thrombosis of the splenic vein, no splenic artery thrombosis or

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  50-year-old female with acute pancreatitis, left upper quadrant
 pain.

 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen of [**2155-2-5**] and [**2155-3-19**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 3 Tesla
 magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging, obtained prior to, during, and after the
 uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (15 mL) of gadolinium-
 DTPA.  In addition, 12 mcg of secretion was administered intravenously as well
 as 300 mL of GastroMARK and 400 mL of Redicat administered orally.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated on an
 independent workstation.

 MRCP WITH SECRETIN:  A peripancreatic fluid collection is unchanged in size
 from the previous CT and contains foci of increased T1 signal consistent with
 small foci of proteinaceous or hemorrhagic pseudocyst formation within the
 larger peripancreatic fluid collection. Small (nonhemorrhagic) fluid
 collection along the left anterior perirenal space is not changed. The
 pancreas enhances homogeneously. The pancreatic duct is not dilated and
 demonstrates normal function after administration of secretin, with fluid seen
 promptly in the proximal small bowel through the level of the ligament of
 Treitz.
 The gallbladder appears unremarkable.  Note is made of mild dilatation of the
 central intrahepatic bile ducts as well as the common bile duct, with abrupt
 narrowing just proximal to the ampulla, without definite meniscus or stone
 seen.

 Numerous tiny foci are seen throughout the left and right hepatic lobes which
 are hypointense on T1WI and show apparent blooming artifact on out of phase
 images on this examination performed at 3T (5b: 12, 18 as representative
 images).  These are somewhat hypointense on T2- weighted images and show
 little to no enhancement.  At least some of these were probably present on
 prior CT of [**2155-2-5**] where arterial/portal venous phase enhancement is
 present in a couple of foci; they are unchanged in size.
 The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and the visualized stomach, small bowel,
 and colon appear unremarkable.  The visualized abdominal aorta maintains
 normal caliber. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy is noted.

 A small rounded focus in the L2 vertebral body which demonstrates increased

 signal on SSFSE and T1-weighted imaging is consistent with a small hemangioma.
 Multilevel degenerative changes are also noted in the visualized spine.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations were especially useful in evaluation of the
 common bile duct and ampullary region.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Findings consistent with pancreatitis with proteinaceous or hemorrhagic
 pseudocyst formation surrounding the pancreatic body and tail, probably not
 changed from CT of [**2155-3-19**].  Fluid collection along left anterior perirenal
 space is not changed. The pancreatic duct appears normal, with normal function
 after administration of secretin.

 2.  Dilation of central intrahepatic bile ducts and CBD with abrupt narrowing
 just proximal to the ampulla, without definite stone or obstructing mass seen,
 could possibly be due to ampullary stenosis, although ERCP is recommended for
 further evaluation.

 3.  Numerous tiny hepatic lesions with susceptibility artifact and little to
 no enhancement demonstrated, are of uncertain significance and could represent
 siderotic nodules.  Fibrosed hemangioma is considered as an alternative for
 several lesions that appeared to enhance on the prior CT.
