Findings
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor
native endocardial border definition.

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. The IVC is
normal in diameter with appropriate phasic respirator variation.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Markedly dilated descending aorta

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened aortic
valve leaflets. No valvular AS. The increased transaortic
gradient related to high cardiac output.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR. Normal LV inflow pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. Indeterminate
PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related
to high cardiac output. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-24**] and tight BP control titrated. Vascular consult
also obtained and CTA of torso done. Transferred to floor and
transitioned to oral BP control. Cardiology and pulmonary
consults also completed to help stratify risk of possible
surgery. Surgery was planned for early the next week. On the
early morning of [**10-28**], the pt. suffered an asystolic cardiac
arrest with ACLS protocol done and shocked when Vfib occurred.
Went into PEA and did not respond despite 25 minutes of
resuscitative attempts. Expired at 8:05 AM. Family subsequently
notified.

 CT TORSO

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  76-year-old woman with aortic aneurysm on outside CT scan.
 Assess thoracoabdominal aneurysm.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple transaxial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
 obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast, utilizing the
 abdominal aortic aneurysm protocol.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted
 images were also obtained.

 CT CHEST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and
 small on the right with adjacent compressive atelectasis.  No pericardial
 effusions.  No axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There is an
 aortic aneurysm originating from the aortic arch (sequence 4, image #15) and
 extending inferiorly to just proximal to the iliac bifurcation.  The aorta is
 markedly tortuous and demonstrates a substantial component of mural thrombus.
 The maximal diameter is 6.7 cm at its proximal thoracic descending portion and
 6.5 cm as it passes through the diaphragmatic hiatus, with an abrupt kink at
 the level of the lower left chest.  The aneurysm tapers to 4.1 cm at the level
 of the takeoff of the SMA.  The celiac and SMA are patent, although there is
 narrowing at the celiac origin.  There appears to be narrowing of the origin
 of the left renal artery, although both renal arteries are widely patent.  Of
 considerable note is the presence of relatively higher attenuation fluid
 dependently in the left abdomen adjacent to the proximal aortic aneurysm,
 which extends inferiorly along the left psoas muscle.  This finding is
 concerning for the presence of an aortic leak.

 The patient is post cholecystectomy.  The liver is normal in size and
 appearance.  No focal lesions.  No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The
 kidneys demonstrate symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis or focal
 lesions.  Left perinephric stranding is noted.

 There is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder, which contains a small
 amount of gas.  There are numerous colonic diverticula, especially in the
 sigmoid colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.

 No suspicious osseous lesions.  There are mild degenerative changes of the
 lumbar spine.

 (Cont)

 Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in the delineation of the above
 findings.

 Findings were discussed with cardiac surgery nurse practitioner, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4519**]
 [**Doctor Last Name 1072**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 6.7 cm at the proximal
 thoracic level extending through the renal arteries to terminate at the
 proximal to iliac bifurcation.  Of note is presence of relative higher
 attenuation left abdominal fluid or soft tissue density adjacent to aorta,
 concerning for the presence of a leak.  These findings were discussed with
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4519**] [**Doctor Last Name 1072**].
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent
 atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Thoracic aneurysm, please assess mediastinum.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  AP supine portable chest radiograph reviewed.  The mediastinal
 contours are markedly abnormal secondary to an aneurysmal and severely ectatic
 thoracic aorta.  Heart size is normal.  There is an ill-defined opacity at the
 left base that likely represents atelectasis, but focus of infection cannot be
 excluded.

 IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal mediastinum with aneurysmal and tortuous
 thoracic aorta.  No comparison radiographs are available.  Cross sectional
 imaging is advised.
