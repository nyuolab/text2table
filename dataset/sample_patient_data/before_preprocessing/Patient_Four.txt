Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname 17862**] was a same day admit after undergoing
preoperative work-up prior to admission. On [**6-6**] he was brought
to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x 3. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-operative day one he was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further care. He had a short run of atrial
fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with beta blockers.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. He continued to slowly improve and worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname 17862**] did
c/o difficulty swallowing- a speech and swallow consult and
video swallow was done and no abnormality was detected. He had
no further complaints of swallowing difficulty. On
post-operative day #4 he was discharged to home with VNA.

Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions.  Indeterminate frontal plane
QRS axis.  Right bundle-branch block.  Generalized low QRS voltage.  Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2155-5-27**] generalized low voltage is seen on the
current tracing.  Clinical correlation is suggested.


Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat. Right bundle-branch block. Low limb
lead QRS voltage is non-specific. Consider prior infero-posterior myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available
for comparison.

 CHEST PA AND LATERAL

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pre-CABG.

 No prior study for comparison.

 Biapical scarring is symmetrical.  Hyperinflation is moderate.  Linear
 scarring or atelectasis is in the mid lung, projecting over the heart on the
 lateral view.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are otherwise normal.  There is no pleural effusion.

 FINDINGS:  The left sided chest tube has been removed.  No pneumothoraces are
 seen on either side.  Lungs are relatively clear.  Cardiac silhouette,
 mediastinum is within normal limits.

  Expected post-op appearance of the mediastinum with lines and catheters in
  standard location. The ET tube is terminating at the thoracic inlet. Small
  bilateral pleural effusions. Lucency at the right lung base, can not exclude
  an anterobasal Pneumothorax, Attention on short term follow-up. (DW

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluate for pneumothorax or effusion.

 SINGLE AP PORTABLE CHEST:  Compared to [**2155-5-27**].  The patient is status post
 cardiac surgery with median sternotomy wires intact and in good position.  The
 endotracheal tube appears well positioned 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube is
 seen in the proximal stomach.  Several midline drains are in place. Right-
 sided Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the pulmonary outflow tract and appears
 well positioned.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits for
 a post-surgical patient.  No significant pneumothorax is appreciated.  There
 is mildly bibasilar opacification within normal limits for postoperative
 patient, likely representing a combination of atelectasis and small pleural
 effusions.  No evidence of significant CHF.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  79-year-old man status post CABG x3.  Please assess swallowing.

 TECHNIQUE:  Oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
 today in collaboration with speech and swallow pathology.

 The oral phase was significant for mildly reduced bolus formation.  In
 addition, oral transit time was moderately increased for solids such as a
 cookie.

 The pharyngeal phase demonstrated mildly delayed laryngeal valve closure and
 epiglottic deflection but these did follow completion while swallowing.

 There was an episode of flash penetration with thin liquids.  No deep
 penetration or aspiration was seen.

 IMPRESSION:  Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia with slightly reduced bolus control
 for thin liquids.  Episode of flash penetration of thin liquids.  No
 aspiration seen.  For further details, please refer to the speech and swallow
 pathologist's note of the same day.
