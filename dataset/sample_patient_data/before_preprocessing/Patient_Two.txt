Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Breast pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
evacuation of right breast hematoma [**2181-3-8**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old female with history of atrial
fibrillation refractory to lopressor, amiodarone, felxanide and
cardioversion who was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic
surgery service from [**2181-2-13**] to [**2181-2-18**] for MINI MAZE procedure.
On [**2181-2-14**] the patient underwent minimally invasive bilateral
thoracoscopic
epicardial pulmonary vein isolation with resection of left
atrial appendage and autonomic ganglia stimulation and ablation.
The patient's procedure was reported to have been
non-complicated. There was noted to be difficulty surrounding
pain control for which narcotics and toradol were required, the
patient ultimately required a paravertebral block finally with
good effect. The patient was noted to develop rapid afib x 1 and
was treated w/ IV lopressor and
amiodarone with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. The
patient was discharged to home on coumadin.
    The patient reports she was doing generally well
post-discharge although she did notice some nausea and
intolerance ot pain meds. 2 days ago the patient reports she was
doing some routine cleaning around her home without difficulty
using her right arm, later in the day she reports sneezing and
coughing frequently with sense of sharp pain in her right breast
during this. The patient noted some ongoing pain, took a
percocet and attempted to go to sleep. She woke up at 2:00a.m.
with ongoing pain and noted a palpable lump on her breast over
area of pain. The patient presented to the ED yesterday a.m. Her
care was discussed with CT surgery with impression she may have
some local bruising related to procedure and recommended
outpatient follow up with pain control. Apparently the patient
represented because of onogoing pain.
.
ED Course: Vitals 97.3, 131/73, 70, 20, 100% RA. In the ED the
patient had an ultrasound performed with wet read revealing for
5.5 x 8.5 x 10 cm heterogeneous collection at 10 o'clock, 7 cm
deep, medial to patient's incision concerning for a post-op
seroma although super-infection not excluded. This was noted not
fluid filled, thereby may be difficult to drain. Additionally,
more diffusely, centered at 2 oclock, there is a large
hypoechoic region approximately 12 x 13 cm, concerning for
intra-mammary hematoma. In the ED the patient was seen by CT
surgery team, no note of this encounter is available for review.
Per ED signout CT surgery did not feel admission was warranted
and recommended outpatient follow up, holding coumadin until
therapeutic. ED felt patient's pain was difficult to control and
recommended admission for this as well as concern for
fellulitis. I contact[**Name (NI) **] CT surgery team when request was made
for admission to medicine. I confirmed that CT surgery team was
not concerned about findings on ultrasound, did not recommend
any INR reversal beyond holding coumadin.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 61 year old female with history of atrial
fibrillation status post MINI MAZE who now presents with right
breast pain with ultrasound revealing for post-op seroma as well
as large hematoma.  She was transferred to the cardiac surery
service on [**2181-3-6**].  INR drifted down and the patient was
brought to the operating room on [**2181-3-8**] for evacuation of right
breast hematoma.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in good
condition.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  She was transferred to the
telemetry floor.  The patient remained in rate controlled atrial
fibrillation/atrial flutter throughout the hospital course.  She
was maintained on amiodarone and lopressor.  Coumadin was
discontinued.  The patient did develop some dizziness and was
found to have orthostatic hypotension.  This resolved with a
bolus of albumin and decrease in her beta blockade.  She made
progress and was discharged home on POD 4.  By the time of
discharge, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

      61 year old female admitted from OR for Evacuation of  hematoma of
   right chest and bronchoscopy s/p Mini-Maze done here on [**2181-2-14**].
   Admitted to CVICU-A room #3. Patient was originally admitted on [**Hospital Ward Name 2014**]
   on [**2181-3-5**] with acute right chest pain with
lump
 on her chest after
   coughing and sneezing at home. Had been sent home on coumadin. INR was
   4 on arrival .
   Ultrasound and CTScan confirmed hematoma in chest. See Metavision for

   Baseline AFib and Aflutter.Alleric to Vancomycine (Redmand Syndrome).
       Arrive Intubated on propofol. OR uneventful except having some
   difficulty with double lumen ETT placement. Multple attemts. Keep
   intubated for a few hours post-procedure. Extubated at 14:00. O2 weaned
   to 2 l N/C. Sat  98-100 %. [**Doctor Last Name **] tube right chest via JP drain. 50 cc
   of blood out since arrival. Old and new echymotic around incision site
   and right arm.

   Was in SR short period after her mini-maze [**2-14**]. Converted back to Afib
   and Aflutter. Rate 90-120
s. No ectopy. Low urine output initially
   after OR. CXRay did show pulmonary edema [**Name8 (MD) 77**] NP. Sat >95 %. K 3.9
   Action:
   Lopressor po restarted low dose. 12.5 mg po given via OG. Got
   amiodarone this am before OR. Dose due tonight.  Lasix 20 mg IV given
   after RBC. Neo started for low BP. 20 meq KCL.
   Response:
   HR 100-120
s. Good urine output post lasix.
   Plan:
   Monitor heart rate. Monitor electrolytes.
