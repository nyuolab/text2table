HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the emergency room, the GI Service was
consulted.  There was initial concern for a variceal bleed
given her manifestations and her history of cirrhosis.  The
patient was electively intubated for airway protection.  She
was put on a Nitrate drip for her potential esophageal
varices and her coagulopathy was reversed with 10 mg of subcu
vitamin K, four units of FFP.  She was also transfused
initially with two units of packed red blood cells.

She was brought to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
observation as well as esophagogastroduodinoscopy.  The EEG
which was performed on the day of admission, did show varices
of the lower third of the esophagus.  These were nonbleeding.
The stomach was normal.  In the duodenum there was a large
necrotic ulcer involving the entire bulb extending to the
second portion of the duodenum.  This was unable to be passed
due to necrosis and clots.  It was felt that this necrotic
mass most likely represented an ulcer which had perforated
posteriorly possibly into the pancreas or into the lesser sac
and that this was likely the source of her bleeding.

At this point in her care, decision point was reached with
regards to the aggressiveness of her care.  Her family was
informed that the nature of her ulcer would likely require
surgical intervention and that the prognosis, even if
operated on, was most likely very poor.  The patient who had
been a DNR, DNI prior to this hospitalization which was
reversed temporarily for the EGD, elected to pursue comfort
measures only as to the philosophy of her care.

The patient was extubated and transferred out of the Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the Medical floor.  Her course on the
floor has been otherwise been unremarkable.  The patient has
been under very good pain control now only requiring
sublingual Morphine Sulfate every two hours.  She has been
maintained on intravenous Protonix 40 units q. 24 hours.  She
is also continuing to receive antibiotics for a concomitant
urinary tract infection.

The Geriatric Service advised giving her two units of packed
red blood cells on the day of admission to the Medical floor
which was carried out.  The rest of her course on the Medical
floor has been otherwise unremarkable.  Her mental status
actually has improved to some extent while being here and her
pain has been under very tight control.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient is being transferred to
the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where she will have Hospice care.

The patient will be sent out on the following medications:
1.  Protonix 40 mg IV q. 24 hours
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg IV q. 24 times five more days.
3.  Morphine Sulfate sublingual 5 mg q. two hours p.r.n. to
be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
